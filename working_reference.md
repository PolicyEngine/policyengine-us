## 3. Assistance Unit Composition

**Source**: TANF 201-1 (effective July 1, 2021); ARM 37.78.103, .206, .207, .208

### Filing Unit vs. Assistance Unit

**Filing Unit** (broader):
> "An application on behalf of a minor child(ren) must include certain relatives living with the minor child(ren). These family members, related to the minor child(ren) by blood, adoption or marriage to the child's natural/adoptive parent, and the minor child(ren) are considered to be a filing unit."

Per ARM 37.78.103, the filing unit includes:
- (a) all individuals in the child's assistance unit
- (b) all individuals with the option to be included
- (c) all persons who would be required members if not excluded for reasons such as "lack of U.S. citizenship, receipt of SSI benefits, or the imposition of a sanction or disqualification"

**Assistance Unit** (subset that receives benefits):
> "After it is determined which family members comprise the filing unit; the eligibility determination occurs to establish which of these members, in addition to the minor child, will have their needs included in the benefits."

Per ARM 37.78.103:
> "a minor child or children and all individuals who live with the child and are related to the child by blood, marriage, adoption, or by law if the child was conceived by artificial insemination, provided that the relationship is within the fifth degree of kinship"

### Required Members (Must Be in Filing Unit)

Per TANF 201-1 and ARM 37.78.208:

1. **Parent(s)** of any minor child included in the assistance unit
2. **Spouse of the parent** of the minor child (including stepparents via ceremonial or common law marriage)
3. **Blood-related, adoptive, or stepsiblings** who are themselves minor children within the age limit
4. **The child** for whom application is made (ARM 37.78.208(1))

Per ARM 37.78.208(3): Parents must be included "regardless of whether the parents are married."

### Optional Members (May Be Included)

**Specified Caretaker Relative (Non-Parent)**:
- Not required to be in the assistance unit
- May request inclusion; if included, all financial and non-financial requirements apply
- If included, their spouse CANNOT be included, but spouse's income must be deemed
- If requesting assistance for multiple children, all must be in a single assistance unit

### Excluded Members (Cannot Receive Benefits)

Per TANF 201-1, the following are excluded from the assistance unit:

1. **SSI recipients** -- Adult SSI clients may qualify as specified relative; SSI 1619B individuals treated as SSI clients; SSI child is considered an "eligible child" for purposes of determining eligibility for other family members
2. **Minor children receiving foster care payments** (whose absence is not temporary) -- NOT considered "eligible children" for other members
3. **Aliens who do not meet qualified alien status**
4. **Individuals fleeing** to avoid prosecution/custody/confinement for a felony
5. **Individuals found to have committed fraud** or intentional program violation
6. **Sanctioned individuals** (non-compliance with employment/training)
7. **Individuals convicted of fraudulent residency representation**
8. **Incarcerated individuals**
9. **Individuals violating probation or parole**

**Key rule**: Income of excluded members (except SSI recipients) still counts toward unit eligibility per ARM 37.78.402(7). SSI recipients' needs, income, and resources are NOT included per ARM 37.78.208(5).

### Total Household Ineligibility

The entire household is ineligible when a required filing unit member:
1. Has a drug felony conviction (after August 22, 1996) with unmet conditions
2. Is participating in a strike
3. Is not in compliance with a Program Compliance review

### Maximum AU Size

Per ARM 37.78.420, income standard tables go up to **20 persons**.

### Caretaker Relative Rules

Per ARM 37.78.103: A specified caretaker relative is "a person related to the minor child within the fifth degree of kinship by blood, marriage, or adoption who lives with the child."

Per TANF 201-3 (effective October 1, 2024), qualifying relationships include:
1. Father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, niece
2. Great grandparent, great-great grandparent, great-great-great grandparent, great-aunt, great-uncle
3. First cousin once removed
4. Biologically/blood related within 5th degree (even if child was legally adopted)
5. Stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister
6. Adoptive parents and their relatives
7. Spouses of any of the above, **even after marriage terminated by death or divorce**

NOT qualifying: "In loco parentis, fictive kin or legal guardians not related within the fifth degree of kinship."

### Minor Parent Rules

Per TANF 201-1: "A pregnant teen/minor's eligibility is considered the same as a 'pregnant woman' with the additional 'living arrangement' non-financial requirement."

### Two-Parent Household Rules

Per ARM 37.78.208(3): Parents must be included "regardless of whether the parents are married."
Per ARM 37.78.207: "If a child spends equal amounts of time with both parents, both parents must be included in the child's assistance unit."

### Pregnant Woman Rules

Per TANF 201-1 and ARM 37.78.606:
- Eligible in **last trimester** (3 months prior to expected month of birth) with no other eligible children
- Pregnancy must be verified by a physician or designee
- Father of unborn (if living with her, married or not) is a required filing unit member
- His income must be deemed; once child is born, he becomes a required AU member

### Unrelated Members

Per TANF 201-1: Unrelated individuals are NOT included in the filing unit. Their income and resources do not count. However, if they make a financial contribution to the filing unit, that contribution IS counted as unearned income.

### Adding/Removing Members

Per ARM 37.78.208(6): New household members are added the month after entry, except newborns who are added at birth/adoption if reported within ten days.

## 4. Demographic Eligibility

**Source**: TANF 305-1 (effective September 1, 2023); ARM 37.78.103, .206

### Age Thresholds

Per ARM 37.78.103, a **minor child** is:
> "a person under the age of 18 years, or older than 18 but less than 19 years if the person is a full-time student in a secondary school or an equivalent program"

Per TANF 305-1:
- Minor child: Under age 18
- Full-time student: Age 18 if attending secondary school full-time (eligibility ends the month after turning 19)

**Implementation approach**: Use federal demographic eligibility (age 18/19 matches federal definition).

### Deprivation Requirements

Montana TANF does not require a separate "deprivation" finding beyond the requirement that the child must live with a specified caretaker relative.

### Residency Requirements

Per ARM 37.78.206: Applicants must be residents of Montana.

---

## 5. Immigration/Citizenship Eligibility

**Source**: TANF 301-2 (effective December 1, 2024, 18 pages); ARM 37.78.220

**Implementation approach**: Use federal immigration eligibility (state follows federal rules per ARM 37.78.220).

### 7c. Self-Employment Income

**Source**: TANF 503-1 (effective January 1, 2018); ARM 37.78.402

#### Definition and 5 Criteria

An individual is considered self-employed when they meet ALL five criteria:
1. Earn income directly from business/trade, not from wages/salary from an employer
2. Responsible for payment of entire Social Security and Federal withholding taxes
3. No employee/employer relationship; services cannot be controlled by an employer
4. Should file self-employment tax forms (though not all do, and some file incorrectly)
5. "Materially participate" in producing the income -- direct activities cause income to be produced

#### Self-Employment Structures

- **Sole proprietorship**: Not incorporated, one or two owners
- **Partnership**: Two or more partners; file 1065 and K-1 forms
- **Independent contractor**: Pays own employment taxes, no employee/employer relationship
- **Sharecropper**: Self-employed if pays costs of doing business and receives portion of net income

#### Entities That Are NOT Self-Employment

- **Corporations**: Income is wages (countable), not self-employment. Corporate income on Schedule E Line 31 is annualized as countable unearned income. Losses (Line 32) are NOT used. Fees to corporate directors ARE self-employment earnings.
- **LLCs and Limited Partnerships**: Treated like corporations. Income other than "guaranteed salaries" is unearned income. "No income from an LLC or limited partnership is net earnings from self-employment."

#### Calculation Formula

```
Gross Self-Employment Receipts
  - Excluded Income (gas tax credits, disaster payments, crop insurance)
  - Allowable Business Expenses
  + Add Back Non-Allowable Expenses (if deducted on tax forms)
  + Capital Gains (if received/expected prospectively)
  = Net Self-Employment Income

Then annualize (divide by 12) or average over period of operation.
```

#### Allowable Expenses (Deductible)

- Materials, labor, tools, rental equipment, supplies, utilities
- Transportation costs for business (at federal mileage rate; NOT commuting)
- Supplies (consumable items)
- Current business expenses (paid, not billed)
- In-home business portion (exclusive use)
- Dependent care meal costs (actual, standard, or Child and Adult Care Food Program rates)
- Interest on business loans

#### Non-Allowable Expenses (Added Back)

1. Capital assets and durable goods purchases
2. Repayment of loan principal
3. Federal, state, and local income taxes
4. Depreciation (Common locations: Schedule C line 13, Schedule C-EZ line 2, Schedule E line 20, Schedule F line 16, Form 8829 line 28, Form 1065 line 16a)
5. Social Security taxes
6. Meal and entertainment costs
7. Transportation to/from work (commuting)

#### Annualization and Averaging Rules

- Self-employment income intended for annual support is **annualized**
- Temporary/seasonal self-employment is **averaged** over the period it covers
- **Always annualized**: Farm income; self-employment income received less often than monthly
- New business: average using income/expenses from months in operation until 12 months reached
- Tax forms should be used when available and current
- A change of $25/month or more to prorated net self-employment income is considered "substantial"

#### Passive Income (NOT Self-Employment)

The following are unearned income:
- Rental income where individual NOT materially participating 20+ hours/week
- Contract for deed income
- Boarder income (in some instances)
- Non-participating investment partner ("silent partner") income

### Earned Income Disregards (Applied to EACH Wage Earner's Earnings, In Order)

1. **$200 work expense** -- flat deduction
   - Level: Per PERSON (each wage earner)
   - Source: State Plan III.F.2.a; TANF 602-1; ARM 37.78.406

2. **25% of remaining earned income** -- percentage disregard on balance after work expense
   - Level: Per PERSON (each wage earner)
   - Source: State Plan III.F.2.b; TANF 602-1

3. **Up to $200/month per dependent** -- actual childcare costs for employment
   - Level: Per CHILD (minor child or incapacitated adult receiving TANF)
   - Source: State Plan III.F.2.c; TANF 602-1

### Obligated Income Disregard (Applied AFTER Combining Earned and Unearned)

4. **Legally binding child support payments** for non-household dependents
   - Level: Per GROUP (filing unit total)
   - Source: State Plan III.F.2.d; TANF 602-1

### Loss of Earned Income Disregard (ARM 37.78.407)

Disregards are DENIED when the wage earner:
1. Has been convicted of fraud or committed an Intentional Program Violation
2. Voluntarily quit or reduced hours
3. Failed to report earnings causing an overpayment

### Deeming Disregards (TANF 603-1, ARM 37.78.406)

Income of certain household members is "deemed" to the assistance unit:
1. Spouse/father of unborn of pregnant woman (last trimester, no other eligible child)
2. Spouse of caretaker relative (when caretaker is included but is not natural/adoptive parent)
3. Qualified alien's sponsor and sponsor's spouse

Deemed person disregards:
- **$90 standard work expense** (for deemed persons)
- NMI amount for deemed individual and dependents not in filing unit
- Payments to out-of-home dependents
- Alimony/child support to out-of-home persons

### Factoring Conversion (Prospective Budgeting)

| Pay Frequency | Factor | Formula |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Weekly | 4.3 | Weekly amount x 4.3 = monthly |
| Biweekly | 2.15 | Biweekly amount x 2.15 = monthly |

Per TANF 601-1: Factoring is **mandatory** for weekly and biweekly income.

## 9. Income Standards (Tables by AU Size)

**Source**: TANF 001 (effective July 1, 2025); State Plan Section III.D; ARM 37.78.420

### Income Standard Formulas

Per State Plan Section III.D (effective July 1, 2023):
- **Benefit Standard** = 30% of 2023 FPL (annual) / 12
- **Payment Standard** = 35% of 2023 FPL (annual) / 12
- **Net Monthly Income (NMI) Standard** = Benefit Standard / 78.5%
- **Gross Monthly Income (GMI) Standard** = 185% of NMI Standard

**NOTE**: The State Plan and TANF 001 both state standards are "Based on 30% of 2023 FPL" and "Based on 35% of 2023 FPL." The standards are pinned to 2023 FPL values and have NOT been updated to 2025 FPL. Only non-cash standards (200% FPL, 250% FPL) use 2025 FPL.

2023 FPL base values (48 contiguous states):
- 1 person: $14,580/year
- Each additional person: +$5,140/year

### Complete Income Standards Table (Current as of July 1, 2025)

| AU Size | GMI | NMI | Benefit Standard | Payment Standard |

### Formula Verification (Family of 1)

- 2023 FPL = $14,580
- Benefit Standard = 30% x $14,580 / 12 = $364.50 --> rounds to $365 (MATCHES)
- Payment Standard = 35% x $14,580 / 12 = $425.25 --> rounds to $425 (MATCHES)
- NMI = $365 / 0.785 = $464.97 --> rounds to $464 (MATCHES)
- GMI = 185% x $464 = $858.40 --> rounds to $859 (MATCHES)

### Formula Verification (Family of 3)

- 2023 FPL = $14,580 + 2 x $5,140 = $24,860
- Benefit Standard = 30% x $24,860 / 12 = $621.50 --> rounds to $622 (MATCHES)
- Payment Standard = 35% x $24,860 / 12 = $725.08 --> rounds to $725 (MATCHES)
- NMI = $622 / 0.785 = $792.36 --> rounds to $792 (MATCHES)
- GMI = 185% x $792 = $1,465.20 --> rounds to $1,465 (MATCHES)

### Additional Person Increments

Per each additional person beyond size 1:
- GMI increment: ~$303
- NMI increment: ~$164
- Benefit Standard increment: ~$128-$129
- Payment Standard increment: ~$150

## 10. Income Eligibility Tests

**Source**: TANF 604-1 (effective January 1, 2018); ARM 37.78.420

### Step 1: Gross Monthly Income (GMI) Test

- Filing unit's gross countable income (earned + unearned, BEFORE disregards) must be <= GMI standard for unit size
- If income exceeds GMI: INELIGIBLE (stop)
- If income is within GMI: proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Benefit Standard Test (Net Income Test)

1. Subtract earned income disregards from gross countable earned income of EACH wage earner:
   - a. $200 work expense deduction
   - b. 25% of remaining earned income
   - c. Up to $200/month/child dependent care deduction
2. Add the unit's unearned income to the balance
3. Subtract the "obligated income" disregard (child support payments for non-household dependents)
4. Result = net countable income
5. Net countable income must be <= Benefit Standard for unit size
6. If net countable income > Benefit Standard: INELIGIBLE (stop)

### Step 3: Payment Standard Test (Grant Calculation)

- If net countable income >= Payment Standard: INELIGIBLE
- If net countable income < Payment Standard: ELIGIBLE
- **Benefit = Payment Standard - Net Countable Income**

### Note on NMI

Per TANF 604-1: "The net monthly income standard is no longer used in the eligibility determination but the standard is used in other areas (i.e., the deeming process) so the standard will remain in the manual."

---

## 11. Benefit Calculation

**Source**: TANF 604-1; ARM 37.78.420

### Formula

```
Benefit Amount = Payment Standard (for AU size) - Net Countable Income
```

Where Net Countable Income is calculated as described in Section 10 (Income Eligibility Tests).

### Minimum Benefit

The minimum benefit is effectively $1 -- any positive result from the formula yields a benefit.

### Maximum Benefit

The maximum benefit equals the Payment Standard for the AU size (when net countable income is $0).

| AU Size | Maximum Benefit |
|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | $425 |
| 2 | $575 |
| 3 | $725 |
| 4 | $875 |
| 5 | $1,025 |

### Rounding

Per the formula verification, rounding is standard (round to nearest dollar). The benefit standards are calculated from FPL and rounded.

---

## 12. Work Requirements

**Source**: ARM 37.78.807; 42 USC 607; TANF 201-1

### Hours Required

Per federal requirements (42 USC 607):
- **Single parent**: 30 hours/week (20 hours/week if child under 6)
- **Two-parent household**: 35 hours/week (55 hours/week combined if receiving federally-funded childcare)

### Allowable Work Activities

Per ARM 37.78.807 and 42 USC 607(d):
1. Unsubsidized employment
2. Subsidized private sector employment
3. Subsidized public sector employment
4. Work experience
5. On-the-job training
6. Job search and job readiness assistance (limited to 6 weeks, 4 consecutive)
7. Community service programs
8. Vocational educational training (limited to 12 months)
9. Job skills training directly related to employment
10. Education directly related to employment
11. Satisfactory attendance at secondary school or GED
12. Provision of childcare to participant in community service

### Exemptions

Per ARM 37.78.206: Adults receiving SSI or ineligible non-citizens are not subject to work requirements.

### Sanctions (ARM 37.78.506)

Progressive sanction structure:

| Sanction | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| **1st** | Reduction of monthly payment by one person's share |
| **2nd** | Case closure + 1 month ineligibility period |
| **3rd** | Case closure + 3 month ineligibility period |
| **4th+** | Case closure + 6 month ineligibility period |

During 1st sanction: "the income and resources of a sanctioned individual will continue to be considered in determining eligibility and grant amount."

Sanctions apply to "all individuals who are considered to be a TANF recipient in the household at the time of the sanction."

Exception: Minor children removed by Child and Family Services or placed in separate child-only TANF households are excluded from the ineligibility period.

Sanctioned individuals must "negotiate and comply with a FIA/WoRC Employability Plan" prior to benefit issuance.

---

## 13. Post-Employment Program (PEP)

**Source**: TANF 604-2 (effective May 1, 2025); ARM 37.78.406, .833

### Eligibility Trigger

Households that lose TANF Cash Assistance eligibility due to **new or increased earned income** may qualify.

### Requirements

All of the following must be met:
1. Household received TANF in the closure month
2. Losing TANF eligibility due to new/increased earnings of an AU member
3. New/increased earnings reported and verified timely
4. All TANF financial and non-financial requirements continue to be met
5. All E/SP required individuals must maintain compliance with Employment and Training

### Benefits

PEP uses **flat benefit amounts** -- NOT based on household size.

| PEP Month | Monthly Payment | Work Pays Incentive |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Months 1-6 | $100/month | $300 in month 1 |
| Months 7-12 | $50/month | $300 in months 7 and 12 |

**Total over 12 months: $1,800** ($600 PEP payments + $300 x 3 Work Pays Incentives = $900 + $900)

### Key Rules

- **Does NOT count toward 60-month TANF lifetime limit**
- Up to **12 consecutive months**
- Enrollment is **automatic** upon TANF closure due to earnings; client can opt-out
- Cannot receive TANF Cash and PEP in the same month
- Child support collections continue; household eligible for CSSP
- Non-compliance results in case closure (NO sanctions, unlike regular TANF)
- Benefits may be reduced to collect outstanding TANF overpayment

### Ineligible Households

PEP is NOT available to households:
1. Serving an ineligibility period due to sanction
2. Having exhausted 60 months of TANF Cash

### Transition Back to Regular TANF

Households losing PEP with good cause for job quit/hours reduction may transition back to TANF Cash. Must apply for Unemployment Insurance when transitioning.

## 14. Prospective Budgeting

**Source**: TANF 601-1 (effective January 1, 2018); ARM 37.78.402, .420

### Methods

1. **Actual** -- used for past months and when all pay in current benefit month has been received
2. **Anticipating** (three options):
   - a. **Averaging** -- for fluctuating income with reliable history
   - b. **Prorating** -- for income covering periods longer than one month
   - c. **Rate/Unit/Frequency** -- for significant expected changes

### Factoring (Mandatory)

| Frequency | Factor |
|-----------|--------|
| Weekly | x 4.3 |
| Biweekly | x 2.15 |

Factoring is mandatory for weekly and biweekly income.

### Self-Employment

- Always annualized (divide by 12) or prorated over period of operation
- Tax forms should be used when available
- Farm income is ALWAYS annualized

### Averaging Rules

- OPA and applicant/client must agree on representative period, number of pay periods, and pay dates
- Unusually high or low payments should be disregarded unless trend is expected to continue
- May need to average regular wages and overtime separately

### Proration Rules

| Frequency | Divisor |
|-----------|---------|
| Bi-monthly | Divide by 2 |
| Quarterly | Divide by 3 |
| Semi-annually | Divide by 6 |
| Annually | Divide by 12 |

### Verification

"Information provided by the applicant/client must be verified with corroborative documents and/or statements from third parties." Client statement alone is never sufficient.

---

## 15. Key Differences from Other States / Notable Features

1. **Income standards are FPL-formula-based** (not arbitrary dollar amounts):
   - Benefit Standard = 30% of 2023 FPL
   - Payment Standard = 35% of 2023 FPL
   - NMI = Benefit Standard / 78.5%
   - GMI = 185% of NMI
   - Standards are pinned to 2023 FPL (not auto-updating)

2. **Life insurance cash value is fully excluded** (ARM 37.78.401(4)(i)) -- significant difference from some states that count cash surrender value above thresholds

3. **IRAs excluded; KEOGH plans countable** -- Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and MyRAs are excluded from resources; KEOGH plans are considered accessible and countable

4. **PEP program with flat benefits** -- unique transitional program with $100/$50 monthly flat payments plus $300 Work Pays Incentives, not counted toward 60-month limit

5. **Progressive sanction structure** -- escalating from payment reduction to 6-month case closure

6. **One vehicle excluded regardless of value** -- no dollar cap on vehicle exclusion

7. **$200 earned income disregard + 25% of remainder** -- applied per wage earner (not per group)

8. **No family cap** on benefits

9. **$3,000 resource limit** regardless of family size

10. **Dependent care deduction is up to $200/month per child** (not differentiated by age of child, unlike some states)

11. **NMI standard no longer used in eligibility determination** -- retained only for deeming process

12. **Child support supplement payment**: Up to $100/month per TANF household (MCA 53-4-260), excluded as income

13. **Deemed person work expense**: $90 (lower than the $200 for regular wage earners)
