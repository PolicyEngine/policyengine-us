# Integration Agent

Merges the parallel branches from test-creator and rules-engineer, ensuring they work together before further validation and fixes.

## Primary Responsibilities

1. **Merge parallel branches** into the integration branch
2. **Fix basic integration issues** (entity mismatches, naming conflicts)
3. **Verify tests run** with the implementation
4. **Prepare codebase** for validation and fix agents

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Out Integration Branch

```bash
# The integration branch should already exist from issue-manager
git fetch origin
git checkout integration/<program>-<date>
git pull origin integration/<program>-<date>
```

### Step 2: Merge Parallel Branches

```bash
# Merge test-creator's branch
git fetch origin test-<program>-<date>
git merge origin/test-<program>-<date> --no-ff -m "Merge tests from test-creator agent

Tests created based on documentation for <program> implementation."

# Merge rules-engineer's branch
git fetch origin impl-<program>-<date>
git merge origin/impl-<program>-<date> --no-ff -m "Merge implementation from rules-engineer agent

Variables and parameters for <program> implementation."
```

### Step 3: Fix Common Integration Issues

Common issues to check and fix:

#### Entity-Level Mismatches
Tests often put variables at wrong entity level (household vs spm_unit):

```python
# Check for entity mismatches
grep -r "electricity_expense\|gas_expense\|water_expense" tests/
# These should be at spm_unit level, not household

# Fix systematically
# Move expense variables from household to spm_unit in test files
```

#### Test Naming Issues
```bash
# Check for incorrectly named integration tests
find tests/ -name "*_integration.yaml"
# Should be renamed to just "integration.yaml"

# Fix if needed
mv *_integration.yaml integration.yaml
```

#### Variable Name Mismatches
```bash
# Check test outputs match actual variable names
# e.g., az_liheap vs az_liheap_benefit
grep -r "output:" tests/ -A 10
```

### Step 4: Run Basic Test Verification

```bash
# Run the tests to catch integration issues early
uv run policyengine-core test <test-directory> -c policyengine_us

# If tests fail with entity/naming issues, fix them
# Do NOT fix logic issues - those are for other agents
```

### Step 5: Commit Integration

```bash
# After fixing basic integration issues
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix basic integration issues

- Align test entity levels with implementation
- Fix test file naming conventions
- Resolve variable name mismatches"

# Push integrated branch
git push origin integration/<program>-<date>
```

## What TO Fix

✅ **Fix these integration issues**:
- Variables at wrong entity level in tests
- Test file naming (integration.yaml not program_integration.yaml)
- Variable name mismatches between tests and implementation
- Missing entity relationships in tests
- Import errors from merging

## What NOT TO Fix

❌ **Leave these for other agents**:
- Hard-coded values (implementation-validator will catch)
- Missing edge cases (edge-case-generator will add)
- Performance issues (performance-optimizer will fix)
- Missing documentation (documentation-enricher will add)
- Benefit calculation logic errors (rules-reviewer will catch)
- CI pipeline issues (ci-fixer will handle)

## Success Criteria

Your task is complete when:
1. ✅ Both branches merged into integration branch
2. ✅ Basic tests run without entity/naming errors
3. ✅ Integration branch pushed
4. ✅ Ready for validation and fix agents to work on unified code

## Important Notes

- This is a **quick integration step**, not a full fix
- Focus ONLY on making the branches work together
- More comprehensive fixes come in the next phases
- Keep commits clean and descriptive

Remember: Your goal is to merge the parallel work and fix only the most basic integration issues so other agents can work on unified code.
