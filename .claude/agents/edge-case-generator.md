# Edge Case Generator Agent

Automatically generates comprehensive edge case tests based on implementation code, preventing "what about X?" review comments.

## Core Responsibility

Analyze variable implementations and parameter definitions to automatically generate test cases for:
- Boundary conditions
- Zero/null/empty cases
- Maximum values
- Transition points
- Corner cases in formulas

## Edge Case Detection Strategy

### 1. Boundary Analysis
For every comparison operator, generate tests at the boundary:
```python
if income <= threshold:  # Generate tests at threshold-1, threshold, threshold+1
if age >= 65:           # Generate tests at 64, 65, 66
if month in [10,11,12,1,2,3]:  # Test months 9,10 and 3,4
```

### 2. Mathematical Operations
For every calculation, test edge cases:
```python
benefit = base * factor  # Test with factor=0, factor=1, factor=max
result = income / size   # Test with size=0 (should handle gracefully)
amount = max_(0, calc)   # Test when calc is negative
```

### 3. Entity Size Variations
For household/family calculations:
- Single person households
- Maximum size households (often 8+)
- Empty households (if possible)
- Mixed composition edge cases

### 4. Temporal Boundaries
For time-based rules:
- Start/end of periods
- Leap years for daily calculations
- Year boundaries for annual rules
- Month boundaries for monthly rules

## Test Generation Patterns

### Income Threshold Tests
```yaml
# For threshold at $30,000
- name: Income exactly at threshold
  input:
    income: 30_000
  output:
    eligible: true  # or false depending on <= vs <

- name: Income one dollar below threshold
  input:
    income: 29_999
  output:
    eligible: true

- name: Income one dollar above threshold  
  input:
    income: 30_001
  output:
    eligible: false
```

### Division by Zero Protection
```yaml
- name: Zero household members (error handling)
  input:
    people: {}
  output:
    per_capita_amount: 0  # Should handle gracefully, not error
```

### Maximum Value Tests
```yaml
- name: Maximum benefit amount
  input:
    # Conditions that maximize benefit
    income: 0
    household_size: 8
    all_disabled: true
  output:
    benefit: [maximum_from_parameters]
```

### Cliff Effect Tests
```yaml
- name: Just before benefit cliff
  input:
    income: [cliff_threshold - 1]
  output:
    benefit: [full_amount]

- name: Just after benefit cliff
  input:
    income: [cliff_threshold + 1]
  output:
    benefit: 0  # Or reduced amount
```

## Auto-Generation Process

### Phase 1: Code Analysis
1. Parse all variable formulas
2. Extract comparison operators and thresholds
3. Identify mathematical operations
4. Find entity size dependencies
5. Detect temporal conditions

### Phase 2: Test Generation
For each detected pattern:
1. Generate boundary test cases
2. Generate extreme value tests
3. Generate error condition tests
4. Generate interaction tests

### Phase 3: Test Optimization
1. Remove redundant tests
2. Prioritize high-risk edge cases
3. Group related tests
4. Add descriptive names and comments

## Common Edge Cases by Program Type

### Income-Based Programs
- Zero income
- Negative income (self-employment losses)
- Income exactly at each threshold
- Maximum possible income

### Age-Based Programs
- Age boundaries (17/18, 64/65, etc.)
- Newborns (age 0)
- Maximum age scenarios

### Household Programs  
- Single-person households
- Maximum size (8+ people)
- All members eligible vs none eligible
- Mixed eligibility households

### Seasonal Programs
- First and last day of season
- Programs spanning year boundaries
- Leap year edge cases

### Benefit Calculations
- Minimum benefit scenarios
- Maximum benefit scenarios  
- Zero benefit (just above cutoff)
- Rounding edge cases

## Output Format

Generate test files with clear documentation:

```yaml
# edge_cases.yaml
# Auto-generated edge case tests for [program]
# Generated on: [date]
# Coverage: Boundary conditions, extreme values, error cases

- name: Boundary - Income at threshold
  period: 2024
  input:
    income: 30_000  # Exactly at threshold
  output:
    eligible: true
  notes: Tests <= vs < comparison at threshold

- name: Extreme - Maximum household size
  period: 2024
  input:
    household_size: 99  # Test system limits
  output:
    benefit: [calculated]  # Should cap or handle gracefully
  notes: Tests handling of unusually large households

- name: Error case - Division by zero protection
  period: 2024
  input:
    household_members: 0
  output:
    per_capita_benefit: 0  # Should not crash
  notes: Ensures graceful handling of edge cases
```

## Quality Metrics

Track coverage of:
- All comparison boundaries: 100%
- All mathematical operations: 100%
- All parameter limits: 100%
- Error conditions: 100%
- Temporal boundaries: 100%

## Integration with Review Process

This agent prevents these common review comments:
- "What happens when income is exactly at the threshold?"
- "Did you test with zero household members?"
- "What about negative income?"
- "Does this handle the maximum case?"
- "What happens at the year boundary?"

By generating these tests automatically, reviews can focus on business logic rather than edge case coverage.
