## üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENT #1: MANDATORY VECTORIZATION üö®

**AUTOMATICALLY FAIL any code that contains if-elif-else statements in formula methods**

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. **THE CODE WILL NOT WORK** in a microsimulation without vectorization.

**WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:**
- Microsimulations operate on arrays of thousands/millions of households simultaneously
- if-elif-else only evaluates scalar values, not arrays
- **Non-vectorized code will CRASH or produce WRONG RESULTS**
- This is about CORRECTNESS, not just performance

### AUTO-FAIL Patterns (WILL NOT WORK WITH ARRAYS):
```python
# ‚ùå AUTOMATIC FAILURE - WILL CRASH WITH ARRAY INPUT
def formula(household, period, parameters):
    # wages is an ARRAY like [50000, 75000, 100000, ...]
    if wages > threshold:  # ERROR: Can't compare array to scalar with if
        tax = wages * rate_high
    else:
        tax = wages * rate_low
    return tax

# ‚ùå AUTOMATIC FAILURE - elif also fails
def formula(household, period, parameters):
    if wages < low:
        rate = rate_low
    elif wages < high:
        rate = rate_med
    else:
        rate = rate_high
    return wages * rate
```

### REQUIRED Patterns (WORK WITH ARRAYS):
```python
# ‚úÖ PASS - Properly vectorized using where
def formula(household, period, parameters):
    # wages is an ARRAY like [50000, 75000, 100000, ...]
    # where() evaluates element-wise on the entire array
    rate = where(wages > threshold, rate_high, rate_low)
    return wages * rate  # Returns array of tax amounts

# ‚úÖ BEST - Boolean multiplication for simple cases
def formula(household, period, parameters):
    return (wages > threshold) * tax_amount

# ‚úÖ REQUIRED - Use select with default for multiple conditions
def formula(household, period, parameters):
    rate = select(
        [wages <= 10_000, wages <= 100_000],
        [low_rate, medium_rate],
        default=high_rate  # MUST use default for performance
    )
    return wages * rate
```

## Review Process Order:

1. **FIRST CHECK**: Scan all formula methods for if-elif-else
   - If found: **IMMEDIATE FAILURE** 
   - Provide specific line numbers
   - Show how to fix with where/select/boolean multiplication

2. **Statutory References**: 
   - Must have legislative acts (not just websites)
   - Acts > Regulations > Government websites

3. **Performance Patterns**:
   - Use `condition * value` instead of `where(condition, value, 0)`
   - Always use `select()` with `default` parameter
   - Prefer selecting rates/multipliers first, then applying

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Thousands separators: 1_000_000 not 1000000
   - One variable per file
   - Use model_api imports

5. **Testing**:
   - Tests must use period format: `2024: value`
   - Test boundaries and edge cases

## Automatic Failure Conditions:
- ‚ùå **Any if-elif-else in formula methods (CODE WILL NOT WORK)**
- ‚ùå No statutory references
- ‚ùå Creating duplicate files (_v2, _new, etc.)
- ‚ùå Non-vectorized loops in formulas
- ‚ùå Using scalar operations on array inputs

## Response Format:

When reviewing, structure response as:

### VECTORIZATION CHECK: [PASS/FAIL]
- List any violations with line numbers

### CRITICAL ISSUES:
- Statutory references
- Performance problems

### RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Improvements and optimizations

### SCORE: [A-F]
- A: Perfect, fully vectorized
- B: Good, minor issues
- C: Acceptable, needs improvements
- D: Poor, major issues
- F: FAIL - contains if-elif-else (code is BROKEN, will not work with arrays)
