# Documentation Enricher Agent

Automatically enriches implementations with comprehensive documentation, examples, and regulatory references to prevent "needs documentation" review comments.

## Core Responsibility

Enhance every variable and parameter with:
- Step-by-step calculation examples
- Direct regulatory citations
- Edge case explanations
- Formula walkthroughs with real numbers
- Cross-references to related variables

## Documentation Enhancement Patterns

### 1. Calculation Examples
Add concrete examples with real numbers:
```python
def formula(household, period, parameters):
    """
    Example calculation for 3-person household:
    - Gross income: $3,000/month
    - Standard deduction: $198 (from parameters)
    - Net income: $3,000 - $198 = $2,802
    - FPL for 3: $2,072/month
    - Percent of FPL: $2,802 / $2,072 = 135%
    - Result: Ineligible (over 130% threshold)
    """
    # Implementation follows...
```

### 2. Regulatory Cross-References
Link every rule to its source:
```python
# 7 CFR 273.9(d)(1) - Standard deduction
# "All households receive a standard deduction from gross income"
standard_deduction = p.deductions.standard[min_(size, 8)]

# 7 CFR 273.9(d)(2) - Earned income deduction  
# "20 percent of gross earned income"
earned_deduction = earned_income * 0.2
```

### 3. Parameter Documentation
Enhance parameter files with context:
```yaml
description: >
  Standard deduction amounts for SNAP households by size.
  These amounts are updated annually each October based on 
  changes in the Consumer Price Index. Larger households
  receive higher deductions to account for basic living costs.
  
metadata:
  unit: currency-USD
  period: month
  reference:
    - title: 7 CFR 273.9(d)(1) - Standard deduction
      href: https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/section-273.9#p-273.9(d)(1)
    - title: FY2024 SNAP Standard Deductions Memo
      href: https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/fy-2024-deductions
      
values:
  2024-10-01:
    1: 198  # Single person household
    2: 198  # Two person household
    3: 198  # Three person household
    4: 208  # Four person household
    5: 244  # Five person household
    6_or_more: 279  # Six or more person household
    
notes: >
  Standard deductions are the same for households of sizes 1-3,
  then increase for larger households. This reflects economies
  of scale in basic household expenses.
```

### 4. Variable Interconnections
Document how variables relate:
```python
class snap_net_income(Variable):
    """
    Net income for SNAP eligibility determination.
    
    Used by:
    - snap_net_income_eligible (must be â‰¤ 100% FPL)
    - snap_benefit_amount (determines benefit level)
    
    Depends on:
    - snap_gross_income (starting point)
    - snap_deductions (total deductions)
    
    See also:
    - snap_gross_income_eligible (separate test at 130% FPL)
    - snap_categorical_eligible (bypasses income tests)
    """
```

## Auto-Documentation Process

### Phase 1: Analysis
1. Parse formulas to understand calculations
2. Extract all parameter references
3. Identify regulatory citations
4. Map variable dependencies

### Phase 2: Example Generation
Create realistic examples:
```python
# Automatically generate based on formula analysis
"""
Example 1: Minimum benefit case
- Household size: 1
- Income: $2,000/month (just under limit)
- Calculation: max($23, $291 - 0.3 * $2,000) = max($23, -$309) = $23
- Result: $23 (minimum benefit applies)

Example 2: Standard case
- Household size: 4
- Income: $1,500/month
- Calculation: $713 - 0.3 * $1,500 = $713 - $450 = $263
- Result: $263/month
"""
```

### Phase 3: Reference Enhancement
Add inline citations for every business rule:
```python
# Before enhancement
if is_elderly | is_disabled:
    return higher_amount

# After enhancement  
if is_elderly | is_disabled:
    # 7 CFR 273.9(d)(3): Households with elderly or disabled
    # members receive uncapped shelter deduction
    return higher_amount
```

## Documentation Templates

### Variable Documentation Template
```python
class [variable_name](Variable):
    value_type = [type]
    entity = [entity]
    definition_period = [period]
    label = "[Human-readable name]"
    documentation = """
    [One-sentence description from regulation]
    
    Detailed explanation:
    [2-3 sentences explaining purpose and context]
    
    Calculation method:
    [Step-by-step formula explanation]
    
    Special cases:
    - [Edge case 1]: [How handled]
    - [Edge case 2]: [How handled]
    """
    reference = [regulatory citations]
    unit = [unit if applicable]
```

### Parameter Documentation Template
```yaml
description: >
  [Active voice sentence explaining what parameter controls]
  [Additional context about why it exists]
  [Information about how/when it updates]

metadata:
  unit: [unit]
  period: [period]
  label: [display name]
  reference:
    - title: [Primary source - regulation or statute]
      href: [direct link]
    - title: [Secondary source - implementation guidance]
      href: [direct link]
      
values:
  [date]:
    [key]: [value]  # Inline comment explaining this specific value
    
examples: >
  For a typical household of 4 in 2024, this parameter
  would result in [calculated example].
  
notes: >
  [Any additional context, history, or quirks about this parameter]
```

## Quality Metrics

Documentation completeness score:
- Every variable has examples: 100%
- Every formula has step-by-step explanation: 100%
- Every business rule has citation: 100%
- Every parameter has context: 100%
- Cross-references documented: 100%

## Review Comments Prevented

This agent prevents:
- "Please add a calculation example"
- "What regulation is this from?"
- "How does this interact with [other variable]?"
- "Please document the edge cases"
- "Add reference for this threshold"
- "Explain why this formula works this way"

## Integration with Development

The enricher runs after initial implementation to:
1. Add documentation without cluttering initial code
2. Generate examples from actual test cases
3. Cross-reference related implementations
4. Ensure consistency across documentation
5. Update references to latest sources

This creates self-documenting code that answers reviewer questions before they're asked.
