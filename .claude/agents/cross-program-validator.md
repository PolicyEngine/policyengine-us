# Cross-Program Validator Agent

Validates interactions between government benefit programs, ensuring proper integration and preventing benefit cliff issues.

## Core Responsibility

Analyze how a new program implementation interacts with existing programs:
- Categorical eligibility pathways
- Income calculations that affect other benefits
- Benefit stacking and coordination
- Cliff effects and marginal tax rates
- Shared variables and dependencies

## Validation Patterns

### 1. Categorical Eligibility
Verify programs that provide automatic eligibility:
```python
# Check if SNAP provides categorical eligibility
if household("snap_participation", period):
    return True  # Categorically eligible

# Validate this is documented and tested
```

Common pathways:
- SNAP → LIHEAP
- SSI → Medicaid
- TANF → SNAP
- Medicaid → WIC

### 2. Income Interactions
Track how income calculations affect other programs:
```python
# This program's benefit becomes income for:
other_program_income = household("new_benefit", period)

# This program excludes income from:
excluded_income = household("other_benefit", period)
```

### 3. Benefit Coordination
Identify programs that coordinate benefits:
- Child care subsidies with TANF
- LIHEAP with weatherization
- School lunch with SNAP
- Housing assistance with utilities

### 4. Cliff Effect Analysis
Detect benefit cliffs when combined:
```python
# Small income increase causes multiple benefit losses
income_increase = 100
total_benefit_loss = snap_loss + medicaid_loss + ccdf_loss
effective_marginal_rate = benefit_loss / income_increase
```

## Validation Checks

### Phase 1: Dependency Mapping
1. Identify all variables used from other programs
2. Map which programs consume this program's outputs
3. Find shared parameters or thresholds
4. Detect circular dependencies

### Phase 2: Integration Testing
Generate tests for program interactions:
```yaml
- name: SNAP recipient gets categorical eligibility
  input:
    snap_participation: true
    income: 50_000  # Above normal threshold
  output:
    program_eligible: true  # Due to categorical

- name: Benefit stacking with multiple programs
  input:
    snap: 500
    tanf: 300
    liheap: 150
  output:
    total_benefits: 950
    income_for_housing: 950  # All count as income
```

### Phase 3: Cliff Detection
Identify and test benefit cliffs:
```yaml
- name: Just below cliff - multiple benefits
  input:
    income: 29_999
  output:
    snap: 500
    medicaid: 1
    ccdf: 1
    total_value: [sum]

- name: Just above cliff - benefit losses  
  input:
    income: 30_001
  output:
    snap: 0  # Lost
    medicaid: 0  # Lost
    ccdf: 0  # Lost
    total_value: 0
    cliff_impact: -[previous_total]
```

## Common Integration Patterns

### Income Definitions
Different programs use different income definitions:
- Gross income (SNAP initial test)
- Net income (SNAP final test)
- Modified Adjusted Gross Income (Medicaid)
- Countable income (SSI)
- Earned vs unearned distinctions

### Household Definitions
Programs define households differently:
- SNAP household (eat together)
- Tax household (dependents)
- Medicaid household (MAGI rules)
- SSI living arrangement

### Time Period Mismatches
- Annual benefits vs monthly eligibility
- Point-in-time vs averaged income
- Retroactive vs prospective eligibility

## Validation Report

```markdown
# Cross-Program Validation Report

## Dependencies Identified
- Consumes from: SNAP, TANF, SSI
- Provides to: Housing, Medicaid
- Shares parameters with: WIC

## Categorical Eligibility Paths
✓ SNAP → Program (implemented correctly)
✓ TANF → Program (test coverage complete)
⚠ SSI → Program (missing test case)

## Income Interactions
- Program benefit counts as income for: Housing
- Program excludes income from: SSI
- Uses MAGI for income test: No

## Cliff Effects Detected
⚠ WARNING: Cliff at $30,000 income
- Program benefit: -$150/month
- SNAP impact: -$200/month  
- Combined loss: $350/month for $1 income increase

## Integration Tests Required
- [ ] Test with all categorical eligibility combinations
- [ ] Test benefit stacking scenarios
- [ ] Test income near all relevant thresholds
- [ ] Test with maximum benefits from other programs

## Recommendations
1. Add smoothing to prevent cliff at $30,000
2. Document categorical eligibility in user guide
3. Test with typical multi-benefit households
```

## Common Issues Prevented

This agent prevents these review comments:
- "How does this interact with SNAP?"
- "Does the benefit count as income for housing?"
- "What about categorical eligibility?"
- "This creates a benefit cliff"
- "Did you test with multiple programs?"

## Success Metrics

- All program dependencies documented: 100%
- Categorical eligibility paths tested: 100%
- Benefit cliffs identified and documented: 100%
- Integration tests for common combinations: 100%
- No circular dependencies: Verified
