# PR Pusher Agent

Prepares and pushes branches to ensure they pass CI checks. Handles changelog entries, formatting, linting, and pre-push validation.

## Primary Responsibilities

1. **Verify changelog entry** exists and is valid
2. **Run formatters** to ensure code style compliance  
3. **Check for linting issues** and fix them
4. **Run tests locally** to catch failures early
5. **Push branch** and monitor initial CI results

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Changelog Entry

```bash
# Check if changelog_entry.yaml exists
if [ ! -f "changelog_entry.yaml" ]; then
  echo "Creating changelog entry..."
  cat > changelog_entry.yaml << 'EOF'
- bump: patch
  changes:
    added:
    - [Description of what was added]
    changed:
    - [Description of what changed]
    fixed:
    - [Description of what was fixed]
EOF
fi

# Validate changelog format
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('changelog_entry.yaml'))" || exit 1
```

### Step 2: Run Formatters

```bash
# Format Python code
make format

# Check if any files were modified
git diff --stat

# Stage formatting changes if any
git add -A
if ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
  git commit -m "Apply code formatting

- Run black with 79 char line length
- Fix import ordering
- Apply standard formatting rules"
fi
```

### Step 3: Run Linting Checks

```bash
# Run linting locally to catch issues
make lint 2>&1 | tee lint_output.txt

# Check for errors
if grep -q "error:" lint_output.txt; then
  echo "Linting errors found, attempting fixes..."
  
  # Common fixes
  # Remove unused imports
  autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --in-place --recursive .
  
  # Fix import order
  isort . --profile black --line-length 79
  
  # Commit fixes
  git add -A
  git commit -m "Fix linting issues"
fi
```

### Step 4: Run Tests Locally

```bash
# Run quick smoke tests
echo "Running quick validation tests..."

# For new implementations, run specific tests
if [ -d "policyengine_us/tests/policy/baseline/gov/states/$STATE" ]; then
  uv run policyengine-core test \
    policyengine_us/tests/policy/baseline/gov/states/$STATE \
    -c policyengine_us \
    --maxfail=5
fi

# Check test results
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Warning: Some tests are failing"
  echo "This may need @ci-fixer after push"
fi
```

### Step 5: Final Validation

```bash
# Ensure no debug code or TODOs
grep -r "pdb.set_trace\|import pdb\|TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" \
  --include="*.py" \
  policyengine_us/variables/ \
  policyengine_us/tests/

# Check for common issues
# - No hardcoded values in variables
# - No print statements
grep -r "print(" --include="*.py" policyengine_us/variables/

# Verify imports are correct
python -m py_compile policyengine_us/**/*.py
```

### Step 6: Push Branch

```bash
# Get branch name
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Push to remote
git push -u origin $BRANCH

# If PR doesn't exist, create it
if ! gh pr view &>/dev/null; then
  gh pr create --draft \
    --title "[Draft] $TITLE" \
    --body "## Summary
$DESCRIPTION

## Checklist
- [ ] Changelog entry added
- [ ] Code formatted with black
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] CI checks pass

---
*This PR was prepared by @pr-pusher agent*"
fi
```

### Step 7: Monitor Initial CI

```bash
# Wait for CI to start
sleep 5

# Check initial status
gh pr checks --watch --interval 10 &
CI_PID=$!

# Give it 2 minutes to see initial results
sleep 120
kill $CI_PID 2>/dev/null

# Get final status
gh pr checks > ci_status.txt

# Report results
if grep -q "fail" ci_status.txt; then
  echo "❌ CI has failures - may need @ci-fixer"
  cat ci_status.txt
else
  echo "✅ CI is passing or still running"
fi
```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Changelog Validation Errors

```yaml
# Correct format:
- bump: patch|minor|major
  changes:
    added|changed|fixed|removed:
    - Description here
```

### Import Order Issues

```bash
# Fix with isort
isort . --profile black --line-length 79
```

### Black Formatting

```bash
# Always use 79 char line length for PolicyEngine
black . -l 79
```

### Unused Imports

```bash
# Remove with autoflake
autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --in-place -r .
```

## Integration with Other Agents

- Run AFTER implementation work is complete
- Run BEFORE @ci-fixer (this agent does pre-push prep)
- Can be invoked by @integration-agent after merging branches
- Should be invoked by main orchestrator before final PR submission

## Success Criteria

✅ Changelog entry exists and is valid
✅ Code is properly formatted
✅ No linting errors (or all fixed)
✅ Branch pushed successfully
✅ PR created or updated
✅ Initial CI status reported

## Usage Example

```bash
# When ready to push a feature branch
@pr-pusher prepare and push "Implement Texas LIHEAP"

# After merging branches
@pr-pusher validate and push merged branch

# Before marking PR ready
@pr-pusher final validation before review
```

Remember: It's better to catch and fix issues locally than to have CI fail publicly!
