2024 Form OR-40 Instructions
Electronic filing
If you haven't yet tried electronic filing, why not try it 
this year? Join more than 2 million other Oregon tax-
payers who file their returns electronically. 
Direct File Oregon
Use Direct File Oregon to file your return for free. It’s 
easy, safe, and secure. Direct File Oregon is interview-
based software that many full-year residents may use 
to file an original or amended return through Revenue 
Online. 
You can use Direct File with or without a Revenue 
Online account; however, without a Revenue Online 
account, some features may be limited. To sign up for a 
Revenue Online account, you must have:
•	Filed an Oregon return within the last three years, or
•	Received a letter from us, or
•	Made a payment.
Assistance provided. Direct File guides you through 
the return, providing help with things like common 
deductions and credits along the way. It does the math 
for you and computes your tax. If you’re familiar with 
the instructions in this publication before you start, 
Direct File will be that much easier for you. 
Note: If you have a complex tax situation, Direct File 
may not be for you. At this time, Direct File can’t be 
used to file a nonresident or part-year resident return. 
Federal return needed. Your federal return must be 
filed separately with the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS). You’ll need to have the information from your 
federal return and schedules available when you use 
Direct File Oregon. 
For more information about Direct File Oregon, includ-
ing a complete list of everything you’ll need to get 
started, go to www.oregon.gov/dor and look for the 
link on our Individuals webpage.
E-file
E-filing is another fast way to file your return and 
receive your refund. Electronic returns are received 
and processed with more accuracy and speed than 
paper returns, greatly reducing errors and delays. E-fil-
ing uses secure technology to ensure the safety of your 
personal information when it’s sent to the IRS and the 
Department of Revenue.
Oregon participates in the IRS Federal/State E-file pro-
gram. This program allows you to electronically file 
both your federal and Oregon returns at the same time. 
If you’ve already filed your federal return, you can still 
electronically file your Oregon return.
You can take advantage of e-file in one of two ways:
1.	Ask your tax preparer.
	
If your tax preparer is an authorized IRS e-file pro-
vider, your preparer can electronically file your fed-
eral and Oregon returns. Many Tax-Aide and Tax 
Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) sites set up by the 
IRS are authorized IRS e-file providers.
2.	 Use online tax preparation software.
	
You can file your federal and state returns from 
your home, work, or library computer using Oregon-
approved online tax preparation products. Go to our 
website at ­www.oregon.gov/dor/e-filing for a list of 
tax preparation products to use in preparing your 
federal and Oregon returns.
You may be eligible for free e-file. Several tax prepara-
tion software providers offer free online electronic tax 
filing. You can also try Oregon Free File Fillable Forms. 
These online forms are an electronic version of paper 
return forms. Entering your information is just like fill-
ing in paper forms. For free online tax preparation pro-
grams, go to ­www.oregon.gov/dor/e-filing.

2024 Form OR-40 Instructions
Federal tax law
No extension to pay. Oregon doesn’t allow an exten-
sion of time to pay your tax, even if the IRS allows an 
extension. Your 2024 Oregon tax is due April 15, 2025.
Federal law connection. Oregon has a rolling tie to 
changes made to the definition of federal taxable 
income, with the exceptions noted below. For all other 
purposes, Oregon is tied to federal income tax laws as 
amended and in effect on December 31, 2023.
Oregon exceptions to federal law. Oregon is discon-
nected from the business income deduction allowed by 
Section 199A of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Due 
to the way Oregon’s returns are designed, no addition 
is required. Oregon is also disconnected from IRC Sec-
tion 139A­, the tax exemption for federal subsidies for 
employer prescription drug plans. If you have this type 
of business income, you’ll have an addition on your 
Oregon return. 
Oregon is disconnected from IRC Section 529 tax 
exemption for earnings on higher education savings 
plan funds used for K-12 tuition. Funds in Oregon Col-
lege Savings Plan and MFS 529 Savings Plan accounts 
may be used for higher education expenses only. If you 
based a previous subtraction or credit on contributions 
that are withdrawn and used for K-12 tuition, you may 
need to report an addition or tax recapture on your 
Oregon return. See "Additions" and "Additions to tax"  
in Publication OR-17 for more information.
New information
Wildfire settlement or judgment subtractions. You 
may be able to subtract income from a settlement or 
judgment related to a wildfire that hasn't been deducted 
elsewhere on your federal or Oregon return. Legal 
expenses related to the settlement or judgment may 
also be subtracted. Returns for tax years 2018 through 
2021 may be amended to claim the subtractions if they 
are filed by May 14, 2025. See our website or Publication 
OR-17 for more information.
Voluntary self-identification. Oregon will now be ask-
ing you to voluntarily identify your race or ethnicity 
when you file Form OR-40. You can select up to three 
race or ethnicity categories using Form OR-VSI. The 
information gathered from Form OR-VSI will be used 
only for research purposes to help make Oregon's tax 
laws more equitable. For more information, see Form 
OR-VSI Instructions or our website.
Form 1099-G is no longer being mailed. We will send 
you an informational postcard about Form 1099-G if 
you received an Oregon income tax refund in 2024 and 
you claimed itemized deductions on your 2023 fed-
eral return. The postcard will tell you how to get your 
Form 1099-G through Revenue Online. The form will 
be available by January 31. If you don't have internet 
access, contact us by phone for assistance.
Oregon Kids Credit. For 2024, the income limit for the 
full credit is $25,750. The maximum credit amount 
for 2024 is $1,000 per qualifying dependent child, and 
phases down to zero for income at or above $30,750. See 
the instructions for line 37.
Higher education savings and ABLE account credit 
limits. The 2024 limits for the credits for contributions 
made to a higher education savings account (Oregon 
College Savings Plan or MFS 529 Savings Plan) or an 
ABLE account are $360 if you're married and filing a 
joint return or $180 for all others. See "Refundable cred-
its" in Publication OR-17 for more information.
First-time home buyer savings account (FTHBSA) 
subtraction. The limits for this subtraction are now 
adjusted for inflation. The 2024 maximum limits for 
the FTHBSA subtraction are $11,865 for joint account 
holders who file a joint return and $5,930 for all other 
account holders. For phaseout limits and other infor-
mation, see "Subtractions" in Publication OR-17.
Federal tax liability subtraction. The 2024 federal tax 
subtraction limit is $8,250 ($4,125 for married filing 
separately). It may be limited further based on your 
adjusted gross income (AGI). See the instructions for 
line 10.

2024 Form OR-40 Instructions
Important reminders
Federal return. When you file your Oregon return, you 
must include a copy of your federal Form 1040, 1040-SR, 
or 1040-NR with Schedules 1 through 3 (if applicable), or 
Form 1040-X if you're filing an amended return. Items 
on your Oregon return may be adjusted or denied if 
your federal return isn't included.
Schedule OR-ASC. Are you reporting an Oregon addi-
tion or claiming any Oregon subtractions or credits 
that have a three-digit code? If so, you must include 
Schedule OR-ASC when you file your Oregon return. 
Items with a code may be adjusted or denied if Sched-
ule OR-ASC isn't included with your return. A list of 
current codes can be found in Publication OR-CODES, 
Publication OR-17, or on our website. You can down-
load these publications along with Schedule OR-ASC 
and its instructions from our website or contact us to 
order them.
Publication  OR-17. Publication OR-17 is your guide 
to Oregon personal income taxes. It covers the gen-
eral rules for filing an Oregon income tax return 
and expands on the information contained in these 
instructions. Publication OR-17 also explains Oregon's 
tax laws to make sure you pay only the tax you owe and 
no more. You can download Publication OR-17 from 
our website or contact us to order it.
Transit self-employment tax. If you're self-employed 
and doing business within the Lane Transit District 
(LTD) or the TriMet District (Clackamas, Multnomah, 
and Washington counties), you may need to pay transit 
self-employment tax. See the instructions for Form OR-
LTD or Form OR-TM on our website or contact us for 
more information.
Statewide transit tax - individuals. If you're an Oregon 
resident working for an employer outside the state who 
doesn't withhold Oregon taxes from your pay, you may 
need to report and pay Oregon's statewide transit tax. 
See the instructions for Form OR-STI on our website or 
contact us for more information.
Data security breaches. Tax professionals suffering 
a data breach associated with tax return preparation 
must report the breach promptly to us. See our website

In addition, file a return if:
•	You’re required to file a federal return.
•	You had $1 or more of Oregon income tax withheld 
from your wages and you want to claim a refund.
•	You may qualify to claim a refundable credit.
How long will it take to get my refund?
Return processing times vary due to many factors, 
including the complexity of your return.
Electronically filed returns are generally received 
and processed faster.
Paper returns must have all required Oregon sched-
ules, proof of tax withheld, and a copy of your federal 
return included to ensure smooth processing. If you 
don’t have a federal filing requirement, create a substi-
tute federal return and check the “calculated using ‘as-
if’ federal return” box on your Oregon return.
Returns mailed closer to April 15, when we receive the 
most returns, can take longer to process.
Also, returns that require additional review can take 
more time to process. Typical reasons for additional 
review include: incomplete documentation, identity 
verification needed, claiming a refundable credit, proof 
of tax withheld needed, etc.
To check the status of your refund, click on “Where’s 
my refund?” at ­www.oregon.gov/dor/personal.
What income does Oregon tax?
An Oregon resident is taxed on all income, including 
income from outside the state. A nonresident of Oregon 
is taxed only on income from Oregon sources.
Residency
As an Oregon taxpayer, you are taxed as a full-year 
resident, a nonresident, or a part-year resident. Note: 
If you served in the military during 2024, see “Military 
personnel” below.
Full-year resident
You’re a full-year Oregon resident if your domicile is 
in Oregon—that is, if all the following are true for you:
•	You think of Oregon as your permanent home.
•	The center of your financial, social, and family life is 	
in Oregon.
•	You intend to return to Oregon when you’re away.
You’re still a full-year resident even if you temporarily 
moved out of Oregon, or if you moved back into Ore-
gon after a temporary absence, during 2024.
You may be taxed as a full-year Oregon resident, even 
if your domicile is outside Oregon, if you maintained a 
permanent home in Oregon and spent more than 200 
days in this state during 2024, unless you can show that 
you were in Oregon only for a temporary purpose.
Nonresident
You’re a nonresident if both of the following are true 
for you:


--- Page 7 ---

150-101-040-1 (Rev. 12-13-24)	
7
2024 Form OR-40 Instructions
•	Your domicile is outside of Oregon: that is, the place 
that you think of as your permanent home, where the 
center of your financial, social, and family life is, and 
where you intend to return when you’re away, is not 
Oregon; and
•	If you maintain a permanent home in Oregon, you 
didn’t spend more than 200 days in this state during 
2024 (or you can show that you were in Oregon only 
for a temporary purpose).
Important. A recreational vehicle (RV) isn’t considered 
a permanent home outside of Oregon.
Special-case Oregon resident.  You may be taxed as a 
nonresident, even if your domicile is in Oregon, if all 
the following are true for you:
•	You don’t maintain a permanent home in Oregon.
•	You maintain a permanent home outside Oregon.
•	You spent a total of 30 days or less in Oregon during 
2024. 
Oregon residents living abroad. You may be taxed 
as a nonresident if you qualify for the federal foreign 
earned income or housing exclusions for U.S. residents 
living abroad. 
Part-year resident
You were a part-year resident if you were an Oregon 
resident for part of the year and a nonresident for the 
rest of the year.
See Publication OR-17 for examples and more informa-
tion about residency.
What form do I use?
Use Form OR-40 if:
•	You're a full-year resident and you're not filing a joint 
return.
•	Both you and your spouse are full-year residents, if 
you're filing a joint return.
Use Form OR-40-P if any ONE of the following is true:
•	You’re a part-year resident and you're not filing a joint 
return.
•	Both you and your spouse are part-year residents, or 
one of you is a full-year Oregon resident and the other 
is a part-year resident, if you're filing a joint return.
•	You (and your spouse, if you're filing a joint return) 
qualified as an Oregon resident living abroad for part 
of the year.
Use Form OR-40-N if any ONE of the following is true:
•	You’re a nonresident.
•	You’re a special-case Oregon resident.
•	You or your spouse are a nonresident, if you're filing 
a joint return.
•	You (or your spouse, if you're filing a joint return) are 
in the military, and you're treated as a nonresident for 
state income tax purposes.
•	You (or your spouse, if you're filing a joint return) 
qualified as an Oregon resident living abroad for the 
entire year.
Military personnel
If you were in the military during 2024, you are taxed 
as a full-year resident only if all of the following were 
true for you:
•	Your domicile was in Oregon (or you elect to be 
treated as an Oregon resident for state income tax 
purposes).
•	You were unmarried, or you were married and filing 
a joint return and your spouse was also domiciled 
in Oregon (or you both elect to be treated as Oregon 
residents for state income tax purposes).
•	Your address in the Defense Finance and Accounting 
System (DFAS) payroll records was in Oregon.
If you’re taxed as a resident, you may be able to subtract 
some or all of your military pay. For more information 
about the military pay subtraction, see “Subtractions” 
in Publication OR-17.
If any of the above are not true for you, you (or your 
spouse, if you're filing a joint return) may be treated as 
a nonresident for state income tax purposes. 
Nonresidents stationed in Oregon. Oregon does not 
tax your military pay unless you elect to be treated as 
an Oregon resident for state income tax purposes. File a 
nonresident return and check the “Military” box if you 
have other income from Oregon sources or to request a 
refund of withheld Oregon tax. 
Military spouses. Unless you elect to be treated as an 
Oregon resident for state income tax purposes, Oregon 
does not tax your wages if your domicile is outside the 
state and you’re in Oregon only to be with your spouse 
who is stationed here. File a nonresident return and 
check the “Military” box if you have income from Ore-
gon sources other than wages or to request a refund of 
withheld Oregon tax. 
For more information, see "Military personnel filing 
information" in Publication OR-17.
Filing for a deceased person
A personal income tax return must be filed for a per-
son who died if the person would have been required 
to file. See “Do I need to file?” on the previous page. 


--- Page 8 ---

150-101-040-1 (Rev. 12-13-24)	
8
2024 Form OR-40 Instructions
Check the “Deceased” box next to the person’s name on 
the return. If you have been appointed personal repre-
sentative or you have filed a small estate affidavit, sign 
the return as ”personal representative.” A surviving 
spouse must sign if it’s a joint return. If there’s no per-
sonal representative, only the surviving spouse needs 
to sign a joint return.
Note: Oregon has an estate transfer tax on estates val-
ued at $1 million or more. The tax is paid by the estate 
using Form OR-706, not by the individuals receiving 
the inheritance. For more information, see the instruc-
tions for Form OR-706.
When should I file my return?
The filing deadline for calendar year 2024 is  
April 15, 2025. If you can’t pay your tax by the due date, 
it’s important to file your return anyway to avoid a late-
filing penalty.
Returns for fiscal filers are due by the 15th day of the 
fourth month after the close of their tax year. 
What if I need more time to file?
If you requested a federal extension to file, Oregon will 
allow the same extension. Don’t include a copy of your 
federal extension with your Oregon return; keep it with 
your records. If you need an extension of time to file 
only your Oregon return, see Publication OR-40-EXT. 
The due date for filing your return on extension is 
October 15, 2025.
An extension doesn’t mean more time to pay.
To avoid interest charges, you must pay all of the 
tax you expect to owe by April 15, 2025. If you can’t 
pay all of the tax you expect to owe, pay what you 
can. You’ll owe interest on any unpaid tax starting  
April 16, 2025, until the date of your payment. You may 
also be charged a penalty for failing to pay your tax on 
time. See “Penalties” and the instructions for line 43.
Don’t forget to check the “Extension filed” box 
on your return when you file. File your return by  
October 15, 2025.
Penalties
If you don’t pay all of your tax by April 15, 2025, you 
may be charged a 5 percent penalty on the unpaid 
amount, even if you requested an extension to file your 
return. Oregon doesn’t allow an extension of time to 
pay tax, even if the IRS does. 
You’ll be charged a 20 percent penalty for failing to file 
your return if you file it more than three months after the 
due date, including extensions. If both penalties apply, 
the total penalty will be 25 percent of the unpaid tax. 
Note: If you fail to file returns for three consecutive 
years by the due date for the third year’s return, includ-
ing extensions, you’ll be charged a penalty of 100 per-
cent of each year’s unpaid tax. 
For more information about these and other penalties, 
see the instructions for line 43 and “Interest and penal-
ties” in Publication OR-17.
Interest on underpayment of 
estimated tax
You may owe interest for underpaying your estimated 
tax if:
•	The tax on your return after credits and withholding 
is $1,000 or more; and
•	You underpaid one or more of your required esti-
mated tax installments.
See the instructions for line 44 and Form OR-10 Instruc-
tions for more information.
What if I need to change my Oregon 
return after filing?
It depends on what you need to change. Follow these 
instructions for amending (changing) your return if:
•	You discover that your income, deductions, or other 
item(s) were wrong. 
•	You used a form that didn’t match your residency 
status.
•	Your filing status wasn’t correct.
•	The IRS or another state adjusted or audited your 
return and it affects your Oregon tax.
•	You have a net operating loss (NOL) carryback.
•	Changes in federal or state income tax laws affect a 
return you’ve already filed.
Don’t amend your Oregon return if:
•	We made changes to your return and you object to 
those changes. You must follow the appeal process in 
the notice we sent you.
•	You’re filing a protective claim for a refund. Use Form 
OR-PCR, which is available on our website or you can 
contact us to order it.
Refer to the instructions for the return you need to 
amend. Visit our website or contact us if you need forms 
and instructions. It may take six months or longer to pro-
cess your amended return. 
There’s a time limit for filing an amended return to 
claim a refund. See the instructions for lines 47 through

2025 estimated tax
Estimated tax is the amount of tax (after credits and 
withholding) you expect will be shown on your return 
when you file.
Do I need to make estimated payments?
In most cases, if you expect your return to show that 
your tax will be at least $1,000 after credits and with-
holding, you must make estimated payments. You may 
need to make estimated payments if:
•	You're self-employed and don’t have Oregon tax 
withheld from your income.
•	You have Oregon Lottery single-ticket winnings of 
less than $1,500.

•	Oregon tax isn’t withheld from other types of income 
(such as pensions, interest, or dividends) and you 
expect to owe tax of $1,000 or more on this income.
•	You’re a wage earner, but after credits and withhold-
ing, the tax on your return will still be $1,000 or more. 
In that case, you may want to increase the amount 
your employer withholds from your Oregon wages. 
For withholding information, go to ­the Individuals 
page on our website and look for Do a paycheck checkup.
Oregon and federal estimated tax laws are not the 
same. See Publication OR-ESTIMATE for more infor-
mation, including:

payments.
• Installment periods and due dates.
• Helpful worksheets and examples.

2024 Form OR-40 Instructions
General instructions for Form OR-40
Step 1: Complete your federal return
Complete your federal return first. Do this even if 
you aren’t required to file a federal return. You must 
use the information from your federal return to com-
plete your Oregon return. You must include a copy 
(front and back) of your federal Form 1040, 1040‑SR , 
or 1040-NR with Schedules 1 through 3 (if applicable) 
with your Oregon return. If you're amending your 
Oregon return and your federal return, include a copy 
of Form 1040‑X and an amended Form 1040, 1040‑SR, 
or 1040-NR with Schedules 1 through 3 (if applicable).
If you don’t provide a copy of your federal return, 
we may adjust or deny your Oregon subtractions, 
deductions, and credits. Include federal Schedules 1 
through 3 (if applicable); don’t include any other fed-
eral schedules unless otherwise instructed. We may 
ask you for copies of other schedules or additional 
information later.
Oregon registered domestic partners (RDPs): To cor-
rectly determine your Oregon tax liability, you must 
complete a federal income tax return as if you were fil-
ing as married filing jointly or married filing separately. 
Check the “Calculated using ‘as if’ federal return” box 
on your Oregon return.
For more information on how to file as an RDP, see Pub-
lication OR-17 or visit our website.
Step 2: Select the appropriate Oregon form
To decide which form to use, see “What form do I use?” 
in the “General information” section.
Step 3: Fill out the Oregon return
Use blue or black ink only for easier reading and faster 
processing. The equipment used to scan documents 
and checks can’t read gel ink or certain colors, and 
using them will delay the processing of your return.
Fiscal-year filers
Write the ending date of your fiscal year in the “Fiscal 
year ending” box on the return.
Check the boxes
Amended return
If you’re amending your 2024 return, check this box. 
See “What if I need to change my return after filing?” 
in the “General information” section for instructions.
Calculated using “as if” federal return
Check this box if:
•	You’re filing as an Oregon RDP.
•	Your filing status is married filing separately for Ore-
gon only because you and your spouse don’t have the 
same residency status. 
•	You didn’t file a federal return.
Short-year tax election
If you’re filing a short-year return due to a bankruptcy, 
check this box and write the ending date in the “Fiscal 
year ending” box.
Extension filed
Check this box if you requested an extension to file 
your return. See “What if I need more time to file?” 
in the “General information” section and Publication 
OR‑40-EXT for more information.
Form OR-24
Check this box if you’re deferring gain on like-kind 
property that was exchanged or converted. You will 
report the gain to Oregon when it’s reported on your 
federal return (federal Form 8824). You must include 
Form OR-24 with your Oregon return or provide it elec-
tronically through your Revenue Online account.
Form OR-243
Check this box if you are attaching Form OR-243, Claim 
to Refund Due a Deceased Person.
Federal Form 8379
Check this box if you’re requesting your joint refund be 
apportioned and you are attaching federal Form 8379. 
For additional information, see “Injured spouse refund 
claims” in Publication OR-17. 
Federal Form 8886
Check this box if you filed federal Form 8886, Reportable 
Transaction Disclosure Statement.

If you were affected by a presidentially-declared natu-
ral disaster in 2024, check this box.

2024 Form OR-40 Instructions
SSN. You must provide your SSN per Section 405, Title 
42, of the United States Code. We will only use it to 
establish your identity for tax purposes. 
Follow these instructions if you’ve filed previous tax 
returns using an individual taxpayer identification 
number (ITIN) and this is your first year filing using 
your new SSN:
• Check the “First time using this SSN” box.
• Write your previous identification number on the 
first line of the “Amended statement” space on the 
last page of your return.
ITIN. If the IRS assigned you an ITIN because you don’t 
qualify for an SSN, enter your ITIN wherever an SSN is 
requested. Refunds will not be issued without a valid 
SSN or ITIN.
If you don’t have an ITIN, you must request one from 
the IRS. To get an ITIN application (federal Form W-7), 
go to ­www.irs.gov or call 800-829-1040.
If you’ve applied for an ITIN but you haven’t received 
it yet:
• Check the “Applied for ITIN” box.
• File your return by April 15, 2025.
• Don’t include Form W-7 with your return. Keep it 
with your records.
• Once the IRS issues your ITIN, mail a copy of your 
ITIN letter to us at PO Box 14999, Salem OR 97309-0990.
Deceased taxpayer. Mark the "Deceased" box for a tax-
payer who died during 2024 or 2025.

not eligible to use the single filing status on your Ore-
gon return. For Oregon, you’re generally required to 
use the married filing jointly or married filing sepa-
rately filing status. For more information, go to our 
website, see “Filing an Oregon return” in Publication 
OR-17, or contact us.
Exceptions for married persons who filed a joint fed-
eral return when each person had a different resi-
dency status. Use Table 2 to determine which return 
form to use if you file a joint return or separate returns 
for Oregon.

How to file separate returns for Oregon
If you’re filing a joint federal return but separate 
Oregon returns, enter your spouse’s name, date of 
birth, and SSN on your return. Report your own share 
of federal AGI and deductions. Also, report your share 
of any Oregon additions or subtractions using this for-
mula to determine your percentage:
Your share of federal AGI
=
Your percentage  
(not to exceed 100%)
Joint federal AGI
Check the “Calculated using ‘as if’ federal return” 
box on your return. You must include the following 
forms with both Oregon returns:
•	A federal Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR with Sched-
ules 1 through 3 (if applicable) prepared as if you had 
filed separate federal returns.
•	A copy of the joint Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR 
with Schedules 1 through 3 (if applicable) that you 
actually filed with the IRS.
If the federal form you filed is an amendment, include 
Form 1040‑X and federal returns as amended for your 
actual and “as if” returns. 
If possible, mail both Oregon returns in the same enve-
lope. Don’t staple the returns together.

gon returns due to a difference in residency.
•	RDPs filing separate federal returns and a joint Ore-
gon return.

Deductions
In general, you can claim Oregon itemized deductions 
or the standard deduction, whichever is larger, but not 
both.
See the exceptions below for:
• Dependents who can be claimed on another taxpay-
er’s return.
• Non-U.S. citizens without permanent resident status.
• Spouses filing separate returns.
16  
Itemized deductions. If you’re itemizing your 
deductions for Oregon, enter the amount from 
Schedule OR-A, line 23. Note: Don’t enter your federal 
itemized deductions; the amount allowed for Oregon 
may be different. You can download Schedule OR-A 
and the instructions from our website or you can con-
tact us to order them.
If you’re not itemizing, enter 0.
17  
Standard deduction. Generally, your standard 
deduction is based on your filing status, as 
shown in Table 5:
Table 5. Standard deduction
Single
$2,745
Married filing jointly
$5,495
Married filing separately
• If spouse claims standard deduction
$2,745
• If spouse claims itemized deductions
0
Head of household
$4,420
Qualifying surviving spouse
$5,495
Standard deduction—Age 65 or older, or blind. If you 
or your spouse turned age 65 by January 1, 2025, or 
were blind at the end of the tax year, you're entitled to 
a larger standard deduction. If you or your spouse are 
permanently blind, you may also qualify for the severe 
disability exemption claimed on lines 6a and 6b.
Check the applicable boxes below line 17, then multiply 
the number of boxes checked by:
•	$1,200 if single or head of household filing status; or
•	$1,000 for all other filers.
Add this amount to the standard deduction for your fil-
ing status from Table 5. Enter the total on line 17.
Example: Joni and Mike are married. By January 1, 
2025, Joni had turned 61 and Mike had turned 67. Joni 
files the return as the primary taxpayer. She checks the 
box for spouse age 65 or older and adds $1,000 to their 
standard deduction. Joni enters $6,495 ($5,495 + $1,000) 
on line 17.
Standard deduction—Dependents who can be claimed 
on another taxpayer’s return. If someone else can claim 
you as a dependent, your standard deduction is limited 
to the larger of:
•	Your earned income plus $450, up to the maximum 
allowed for your filing status (see Table 5); or
•	$1,300.
This limit applies even if the other person doesn't actu-
ally claim you as a dependent on their return.
If you’re a dependent and not married, use the follow-
ing worksheet to figure your standard deduction. If 
you’re a dependent and married, see “Deductions and 
modifications” in Publication OR-17.

sional fees, or other amounts received as pay for work 
you actually performed, and any part of a scholarship 
or fellowship grant you received that is included in 
your federal gross income.
Standard deduction­—Non-U.S. citizen without per-
manent resident status. Your standard deduction is $0, 
but you may claim itemized deductions.
Standard deduction—Married filing separately. The 
standard deduction for married individuals filing sep-
arately is $0 if one spouse itemizes. This applies even 
if the standard deduction is more than your itemized 
deductions.

Tax tables. Use the tax tables to find your tax 
if your taxable income on line 19 is less than

150-101-040-1 (Rev. 12-13-24)	
17
2024 Form OR-40 Instructions
$50,000. Find the range for your taxable income, then 
locate your tax in Column S or Column J:
•	Use Column S if your filing status is single or mar-
ried filing separately. 
•	Use Column J if your filing status is married filing 
jointly, head of household, or qualifying surviving 
spouse.
Tax rate charts. If your taxable income on line 19 is 
$50,000 or more, calculate your tax using the formula in 
the tax rate chart for your filing status.
•	Use Chart S if your filing status is single or married 
filing separately. 
•	Use Chart J if your filing status is married filing 
jointly, head of household, or qualifying surviving 
spouse.
Example 1: Emily, a single taxpayer, has taxable income 
of $19,525. She uses Column S in the tax tables to find 
the tax on income that is at least $19,500 but less than 
$19,600. Emily enters $1,409 on line 20. 
Example 2: Daniel and Madison are filing a joint return. 
Their Oregon taxable income is $75,500. They use the 
formula in Chart J to calculate their tax as follows:
Tax on the first $50,000  
(from the chart)
$3,774
Oregon taxable income
$75,500 
Minus the first $50,000
– 50,000
Excess over $50,000
$25,500
Multiply excess by 8.75%
x 0.0875
Tax on excess over $50,000
+ $2,231 
Total Oregon tax
$6,005
Other tax methods. If you qualify, you can compute 
your Oregon tax using any of the following methods:
Farm income averaging method. Did you have income 
from a farm? You may use the federal farm income 
averaging method to compute your Oregon tax even 
if you didn’t use farm income averaging on your fed-
eral return. Use Publication OR-FIA and Schedule OR-
FIA-40 to compute the Oregon tax using this method. 
You can download them from our website or contact us 
to order them.
If you use farm income averaging to calculate your tax, 
enter the tax amount from Schedule OR-FIA-40, line 
24 and check box 20a. Don’t include the schedule with 
your return. Keep it with your records.
Farm asset capital gain method. Did you sell or 
exchange capital assets primarily used in farming 
because you were getting out of a farming business? 
Or, did you sell or exchange a farming business in 
which you held at least a 10 percent ownership interest? 
If so, you may be eligible for a reduced tax rate on the 
net capital gain from the proceeds. Use Worksheet FCG 
inside Publication OR-FCG to compute the Oregon tax 
using this method. You can download it from our web-
site or contact us to order it.
Enter the tax amount from Worksheet FCG, line 9, and 
check box 20b. Don’t include the worksheet with your 
return. Keep it with your records.
Oregon qualified business income reduced tax rate. 
Did you have business income from a sole proprietor-
ship, partnership, or S corporation in which you mate-
rially participated? If so, you may qualify to use this 
reduced tax rate. For details, see Schedule OR-PTE-FY 
and instructions on our website or contact us to order 
them.
Note: If you elect to use this reduced tax rate for quali-
fying income, the election is irrevocable and must 
be made on your original return. An original return 
includes an amended return filed on or before the due 
date, including extensions. You can’t change the elec-
tion after your original return has been filed.
If you elect to use the reduced rate to calculate your tax, 
enter the tax amount from Schedule OR-PTE-FY, line 
14a and check box 20c. Include the schedule with your 
Oregon return.
21  
Interest on certain installment sales. Did you 
have installment sales that required you to pay 
interest on the deferred tax liability for federal pur-
poses? If so, you must also compute interest for Oregon 
using the same method as for federal. The annual inter-
est rate is 8 percent for 2024 and 9 percent for 2025. 
22  
Total tax recaptures from Schedule OR-ASC. Tax 
recaptures are forfeited tax credits that increase 
your tax. For information about tax recaptures, see 
"Additions to tax" in Publication OR-17. Tax recaptures 
are reported on Schedule OR-ASC. Enter the total from 
Schedule OR-ASC, line C5. Include Schedule OR-ASC 
with your return.
Credits—Nonrefundable
Nonrefundable credits can’t be more than your Oregon 
tax liability. Carryforward credits allow you to claim 
unused amounts in a later year. Standard credits can’t 
be used in any other year. For more information about 
nonrefundable credits, see “Credits” in Publication 
OR-17.
25  
Exemption credit. Depending on your AGI, you 
may be allowed to claim a credit for the exemp-
tions claimed on line 6 of your return.
If your federal AGI is more than $200,000 ($100,000 if 
your filing status is single or married filing separately),

Refundable credits 
Refundable credits reduce the amount of tax that you 
owe. Any amount that is more than your tax liability

Earned 
income 
credit. 
Oregon’s 
earned 
income credit is a percentage of the earned 
income tax credit (EITC) claimed on your fed-
eral return. The percentage is based on the age of 
your youngest dependent at the end of the tax year.  
Note to RDPs: You may claim this credit if you would 
otherwise qualify for the EITC using your “as if” fed-
eral return. 
Schedule OR-EIC-ITIN. If you can't claim any or all 
of the federal EITC because you, your spouse, or your 
child(ren) do not have an SSN that is valid for work or 
are using an ITIN, you may qualify for Oregon's earned 
income credit for ITIN filers. See Schedule OR-EIC-
ITIN Instructions for more information. The schedule 
and instructions are available in English and Spanish. 
Download them from our website or contact us to order 
them.

available for certain taxpayers with qualifying depen-
dent children who were under the age of six at the end 
of the tax year. See "Exemption credit" in Publication 
OR-17 for information about qualifying children.
Eligibility. To be eligible for the Oregon Kids Credit, 
you must:
1.	 Use a filing status other than married filing sepa-
rately. If you're married and filing separate returns, 
you do not qualify for this credit.
2.	 Have one or more dependents age five or younger at 
the end of 2024 listed on your Oregon return.*
3.	 Have qualifying income under $30,750. 
If you're eligible, use the Oregon Kids Credit work-
sheet to figure your credit.
Credit amount. For 2024, the maximum amount of the 
Oregon Kids Credit is $1,000 per qualifying dependent, 
for up to five dependents. Your credit amount may be 
limited by your income. 
* 	Note for divorced, separated, or unmarried parents: 
	
If a child is listed as a dependent on your Oregon 
return only because the custodial parent released 
the child’s dependent exemption to you, the child 
doesn’t qualify for purposes of this credit.
	
If you're the custodial parent of an otherwise quali-
fying child, you may be able to claim this credit even 
if the child's dependent exemption has been released 
to the other parent.

tions for Part B. Otherwise, enter 0 on line 2.
Line 3. Qualifying income. If the amount on this line 
is:
•	$25,750 or less, your Oregon Kids Credit is $1,000 
times the number of your qualifying dependents (up 
to a maximum of $5,000). 
•	More than $25,750 but less than $30,750, your credit 
will be reduced using the steps on lines 5 through 9.
•	$30,750 or more, you can’t claim the Oregon Kids 
Credit.
Part B: Loss add back
Your qualifying income may include up to $20,000 in 
losses deducted from your federal AGI or subtracted on 
your Oregon return. Loss amounts above $20,000 must 
be added back to your income after Oregon additions 
and subtractions.
Line 10. Enter losses claimed on your Form 1040 and 
Schedule OR-ASC (using subtraction codes 321, 355, 
356, or 357 only), as indicated on lines 10a through 10g.

• Line 10b. If you claimed a subtraction using code 
359 or 385, compare your subtraction amount to the 
income reported on Form 1040, Schedule 1, line 3. If 
the subtraction is less than your income, you don't 
have a loss; skip line 10b. Otherwise, subtract the 
income amount from the subtraction amount and 
enter the result on line 10b.
Example 1. Colten reported $8,000 in additional income 
from rental real estate on Form 1040, Schedule 1, line 
5. He also reported a $6,000 farm loss on Form 1040, 
Schedule 1, line 6. Colten enters 0 on line 10d of the 
worksheet for rental real estate, as he did not have a loss 
reported on Form 1040, Schedule 1, line 5. He enters 
6,000 on line 10e, as he did report a farm loss on Form 
1040, Schedule 1, line 6. Colten enters his total losses of 
$6,000 on line 10h. He enters 0 on line 10, because his 
total losses minus 20,000 are less than 0. He also enters 
0 on line 2.
Example 2. Michaela reported a business loss of 
($15,500) on Form 1040, Schedule 1, line 4. She enters 
15,500 on line 10b of the worksheet. She had a rental real 
estate loss of ($8,000) reported on Form 1040, Schedule

2025. If you requested an extension, your return must 
be filed by October 15, 2025. 
Round the total of penalties and interest to the near-
est whole dollar. For more information and examples 
showing how penalties and interest are calculated, see 
“Interest and penalties” in Publication OR-17.
Penalties
Penalty amounts are based on the tax after all credits 
shown on your return minus payments that you made 
by the due date of the return. To find your tax after all 
credits, start with your tax after standard and carry-
forward credits on line 31, then subtract the refundable 
credit amounts on lines 36 through 39. 
Failure-to-file penalty. Include a penalty for failure to 
file a return if:
• 	Your return is filed more than three months after the 
due date (or extension due date); and 
• 	You didn’t pay all of your tax by April 15, 2025. 
The penalty for failure to file is 20 percent of your tax 
after all credits that wasn’t paid by April 15, 2025. 
Failure-to-pay penalty. Include a penalty for failure to 
pay if:
• 	Less than 90 percent of your tax after all credits was 
paid by April 15, 2025, or
• 	You paid at least 90 percent of your tax after credits 
by April 15, 2025, but you aren’t paying the balance of 
unpaid tax in full when you file.
The penalty for failure to pay is 5 percent of your tax 
after all credits that wasn’t paid by April 15, 2025.
Failure to file and pay. If both penalties apply, your 
total penalty will be 25 percent of your tax after all 
credits that wasn’t paid by April 15, 2025. 
First-time home buyer savings account (FTHBSA) 
penalty for nonqualified withdrawal. Include a pen-
alty of 5 percent of the funds withdrawn from your 
FTHBSA if you withdrew funds from your account for 
a purpose other than pur­chasing a home.
No penalty will be imposed if: 
• The account holder: 
 
— Dies. 
 
— Files bankruptcy. 
 
— Becomes permanently unable to regularly per­
form work at a gainful and suitable occupation 
due to loss of any bodily function. 
• The funds are withdrawn more than 10 years after

This penalty is in addition to all other penalties pro-
vided by law. Withdrawn funds that are subject to this 
penalty also must be added back to Oregon income. See 
this topic in “Additions” in Publication OR-17.
Interest on unpaid tax
You’ll owe interest on the amount of tax that wasn’t 
paid by April 15, 2025. Interest starts accruing on  
April 16, 2025 and continues to accrue every day, includ-
ing the date of your payment. 
Interest is figured daily, based on a 365-day year. The 
annual interest rate for 2025 is 9 percent, or 0.0247 per-
cent per day. 
To figure your interest, count the number of days start-
ing with April 16, 2025, and ending with the date of 
your payment. Multiply your unpaid tax by the num-
ber of days, then multiply that amount by 0.000247 (the 
daily rate converted to a decimal). 
Interest rate increase. If we bill you for unpaid tax, and 
the tax isn’t paid in full within 60 days from the date of 
our billing notice, the annual interest rate increases by 
4 percentage points, to 13 percent. 
Amended return. If you’re amending your return, cal-
culate the interest based on the additional amount of 
tax you must pay (line 5 of the Amended worksheet).
44  
Interest on underpayment of estimated tax. 
Underpayment interest is charged if:
• Your tax after all credits and withholding is $1,000 
or more;
• You were required to make estimated tax payments;
•	One or more of your required installments was 
underpaid; and
• You don’t qualify for an exception. 
Note: You could be charged interest on underpayment 
of estimated tax even if line 41 shows an overpayment.
See Form OR-10 Instructions to determine if you owe 
underpayment interest or qualify for an exception. 
Download Form OR-10 and the instructions from our 
website or contact us to order them.
If you owe underpayment interest, enter the amount 
from line 4 of Form OR-10. If you qualify for an excep-
tion, enter the exception number from line 1 of the form 
inside box 44a. If you used the Annualized Income Work-
sheet (located in Form OR-10 Instructions) to figure your 
interest, check box 44b. Include Form OR-10 with your 
return. Keep your underpayment interest worksheets 
and any required statements with your records.
Amount due
46  
Amount you owe. Enter your total unpaid tax 
plus penalties and interest. Note: If you have 
an overpayment on line 41 and the overpayment is 
less than the total penalties and interest you entered 
on line  45, enter the amount from line 45 minus the 
amount on line 41.

Amount to pay. If you’re filing your return on or before 
the due date (without extensions), pay the amount 
shown on this line. If you’re filing your original return 
after the due date, subtract any payments you made 
after the due date of the return (without extensions) 
from the amount on this line before you make your 
payment. For amended returns, pay the amount shown 
on the Amended Worksheet, line 11.
Payment options
You may pay electronically from your checking or sav-
ings account, by credit card, or with a check, cashier’s 
check, or money order. Cash payments can be made 
only at our main office in Salem. If the amount due is 
less than $2, no payment is required.
Electronic payment from your checking or  
savings account
You can pay your current year income taxes, 2025 esti-
mated income taxes, any prior year taxes due, and 
amended return taxes directly from your checking or 
savings account. There is no fee to use this service.
This option is available only through Revenue Online.
Direct debit may be available with Direct File or e-filed 
returns at the time of filing.
Credit card payments
You can pay with your Discover, MasterCard, or Visa 
credit card. The service provider will charge you a 
convenience fee. The service provider will tell you 
what the fee is during the transaction; you will have 
the option to continue or cancel the transaction before 
entering your credit card information. If you complete 
the credit card transaction, you will receive a confir-
mation number. Keep this confirmation number as 
proof of payment—don’t send it with your return.

website or contact us by phone.

a payment with your return or making an electronic 
payment. See Form OR-40-V Instructions for additional 
information.

you can. Contact us and we will help you set up a pay-
ment plan for the remaining amount.
Refund
47  
Refund. Enter your overpayment from line 
41 minus any penalty or interest from line 45.  
Note: If the total penalty and interest is more than your 
overpayment, see the instructions for line 46.
You have three years from the due date of the return 
to file a claim for your refund. By law, we can’t issue 
a refund if you file your return more than three years 
after the return’s due date (without extensions) or if the 
refund is less than $1. For more information about the 
time limit for claiming a refund, see “Payments and 
refunds” in Publication OR-17.
Interest on refunds. See “Interest and penalties” in 
Publication OR-17 for information about interest paid 
on refunds. 
Refund applications
If line 47 shows a refund, you may use some or all of it to:
•	Make an estimated tax payment for a later year.
•	Donate to one or more of the charitable organizations 
listed on Schedule OR-DONATE.
•	Contribute to the political party of your choice.
•	Make a deposit to an Oregon higher education sav-
ings plan account.
Each of these applications will reduce your refund. The 
combined total of all applications can’t be more than the 
amount of your refund.
Note: A refund of overpaid tax will be offset against 
outstanding debt before any amount is applied or 
refunded to you.
Instructions for amended returns. If line 5 of the 
Amended worksheet shows a refund, you can use 
some or all of it for the refund applications listed above. 
However, you can’t reduce any amounts you’ve already 
applied from a refund on your original return. See the 
instructions for each application for details.
48  
Apply refund as estimated tax payment. Enter 
the amount of your refund you want to apply as 
an estimated tax payment for a later year. The payment 
will be applied to the 2025 tax year unless you're filing 
this return after January 15, 2026. For more information 
about open estimated tax accounts, see “Payments and 
refunds” in Publication OR-17.

which you’re filing it.
50  
Political party checkoff. You may use your 
refund to contribute $3 to the Oregon political 
party of your choice. If you’re filing a joint return, you 
and your spouse may each contribute $3. Note: Your 
contribution will reduce your refund and does not 
qualify for the political contribution credit.

party’s code from the alphabetized list below.
 
— If you contribute, enter one code in box 50a.

than your total contribution amount.
•	You enter an amount but don’t designate a party (or 
parties).
•	You designate a party (or parties) but don’t enter an 
amount.
•	You enter more than one party code per taxpayer.
Instructions for amended returns. Enter the amount, 
if any, from a refund on your original return that you 
applied as a political party contribution. If line 5 of the 
Amended worksheet shows a refund and you didn’t 
make the maximum political party contribution on 
your original return, you may use the refund to make a 
contribution on your amended return. 
51  
Oregon higher education savings plan depos-
its. Enter the amount from line 5 of Schedule 
OR-529. For minimum deposit amounts and other

You can also use Schedule OR-529 to provide your 
information to the Oregon Treasury Savings Network 
if you'd like them to set up an Oregon College Savings 
Plan account for you. However, you can make contri-
butions from a refund on your return only after the 
account has been created. See Schedule OR-529 Instruc-
tions for details.
Note: If the amount of your refund—after any applica-
tion as a payment of estimated tax, charitable checkoff 
donation, or political party contribution—is less than 
the total amount you want to deposit, no deposit will 
be made.
Instructions for amended returns. Enter the amount, 
if any, from a refund on your original return that you 
applied as an Oregon higher education savings plan 
deposit. If line 5 of the Amended worksheet shows a 
refund, add the amount you want to apply as a deposit 
and include an amended Schedule OR-529 with your 
amended return. The refund will be applied for the 
year in which you’re filing the amended return.
53  
Net refund. You must reduce your refund by 
any amounts applied as a payment of estimated 
tax, charitable checkoff donations, political party con-
tributions, and Oregon higher education savings plan 
deposits. By law, we can’t issue or apply a refund if

Direct deposit
54  
In most cases, we can deposit your refund 
directly into your checking or savings account 
instead of mailing you a check. However, federal bank-
ing regulations prevent us from making a refund by 
direct deposit if the final destination is an account 
outside the United States. In that case, we must issue a 
paper check instead.
Before you enter your information, verify that your 
deposit will be accepted and confirm your routing and 
account numbers. You can find a diagram of a personal 
check showing where these numbers are located in the 
“Payments and refunds” section of Publication OR-17.
Follow these steps to make sure your refund will be 
deposited into the correct account:
1.	 Check the box if the final destination for your refund 
would be an account outside the United States.  
Note: If you check this box, you will be issued a 
paper check.
2.	 Check the appropriate box, either checking or sav-
ings, but not both.
3.	 Enter your nine-digit routing number. Routing 
numbers begin with the digits 01 through 12, 21 
through 32, or 61 through 72.
4.	 Enter your account number. Account numbers can 
be up to 17 characters (both numbers and letters). 
Don’t include hyphens, spaces, or special symbols.
5.	 Double-check the account and routing numbers. 
These numbers can’t be changed after the return 
is filed.

Signature block
Signature(s). Be sure to sign and date your return. If 
you’re filing a joint return, both taxpayers must sign. 
By signing the return, you acknowledge, under penalty 
of false swearing, that the information on the return 
and any attachments is true, correct, and complete.
Minor child’s return. If your child can’t sign their tax 
return, you may sign the child’s name as their legal 
agent. Sign the child’s name and then write “By [your 
signature], parent (or other legal guardian) of minor 
child.”
Preparer signature. Anyone who prepares, advises, 
or assists in preparing personal income tax returns 
in exchange for compensation of any kind must be 
licensed to prepare Oregon returns and must sign the 
return. 
Signing the return doesn't grant your preparer the right 
to represent you or make decisions on your behalf. For 
more information about representation and authoriza-
tion, download Form OR-AUTH-REP and instructions 
from our website or contact us to order them. 
Contact the following agencies to check the status of 
your Oregon tax practitioner:
•	State Board of Tax Practitioners at 503-378‑4034 
(Salem) for licensed tax consultants or preparers, or 
go to ­www.oregon.gov/obtp.
•	State Board of Accountancy at 503-378-4181 (Salem) 
for public accountants and certified public accoun-
tants, or go to ­www.oregon.gov/boa.
Preparer license number. Licensed tax consultants 
and tax preparers: enter your license number. CPAs: 
enter your certificate number. Tax-Aide volunteers: 
enter your TCE site number. All others: leave blank. 
Don’t enter your driver license number.
Form OR-VSI
The Oregon legislature’s goal is to make Oregon’s tax 
policies equitable for everyone. To help in this effort, 
you may voluntarily provide information about your 
race or ethnicity when you file your Oregon return, 
using Form OR-VSI. 
On Form OR-VSI, you may identify your primary race 
or ethnicity (or indicate that you don’t have one) and 
up to two additional races or ethnicities. There’s also 
a way to indicate that you aren’t sure about your race 
or ethnicity. If you’re married and filing a joint return, 
you and your spouse complete separate forms.
The information you provide will be used for research 
purposes only. For more information, see Form OR-VSI 
Instructions or go to our website and look for “Volun-
tary Self-Identification.” You can download the form 
and instructions from our website or contact us to 
order them.
Before you file
Copy of federal return. Before you assemble your Ore-
gon return, make a copy of both sides of your federal 
Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, along with Schedules 
1 through 3 (as applicable), or Form 1040-X. 
Don’t include any other federal schedules. Keep these 
with your records; we may ask for them later. 
If you created an “as if” federal return, use blue or black 
ink to label it “as if” on the top left corner. Include it 
along with the copy of your actual federal return (and 
any amendments).

2024 Form OR-40 Instructions
Failure to include your federal return will delay pro-
cessing, and items claimed on your Oregon return 
may be adjusted or denied.
Amended Oregon return. If you’re amending your 
Oregon return due to changes to your federal return or 
a return you filed with another state, include a copy of 
your amended or corrected federal or other state return 
or audit report. If you’re amending only your Oregon 
return, include a copy of your original federal or other 
state return. 
Assemble your Oregon return. Assemble your return 
in the order shown below. If a form has more than one 
page, be sure that you’ve included all pages and that 
they’re all from the same 2024 form. For example, if 
you’re filing Schedule OR-WFHDC, Schedule OR-A, 
or Schedule OR-ASC, be sure that “2024 Schedule OR-
WFHDC”, "2024 Schedule OR-A", or "2024 Schedule OR-
ASC" is printed at the top of each page and that you’ve 
included all pages associated with each schedule.
Important: Don’t use staples, paperclips, tape, or 
other fasteners. Doing so will delay processing. 
1. 		Payment by check or money order, if any. Don’t use 
a voucher.
2. 		Form(s) W-2 and 1099 showing Oregon tax withheld.
3. 		Form OR-40.
4. 		Schedule OR-A.
5. 		Schedule OR-ASC.
6. 		Schedule OR-ADD-DEP.
7. 		Schedule OR-DONATE.
8. 		Schedule OR-529.
9. 		Schedule OR-PTE-FY.
10.		Form OR-10.
11. 	Schedule OR-EIC-ITIN.
12. 	Schedule OR-WFHDC.
13. Form OR-VSI.
14. Other Oregon schedules required to be included 
with your return.
15. 	If you’re an RDP filing separately for Oregon, your 
partner’s Oregon return. 
16. 	Your federal return(s) and schedules.
Note: If you’re making an estimated tax payment for 
2025 by check or money order, send the payment in a 
separate envelope with a completed Form OR-40-V. 
Don’t include your 2025 payment or voucher with 
your 2024 return. You can download the voucher and 
instructions from our website or contact us to order 
them.
Avoid processing delays
Type or clearly print your name, date of birth, SSN, 
complete mailing address, and daytime phone number 
on your return.
Include all pages of your Oregon return.
Double-check your figures and other numbers, 
including your SSN. Errors will delay processing. 
Common mistakes are:
•	Math errors. 
•	A wrong amount claimed for the federal tax liability 
subtraction. 
•	Using the wrong line or column on the tax tables.
•	Using the wrong tax chart. 
If you have tax to pay, review the instructions for line 46.
Verify your account information if you’re requesting a 
refund by direct deposit.
Sign your return. Both spouses must sign a joint return.
Include legible copies of all W-2 and 1099 forms show-
ing Oregon income tax withheld. Place them on top of 
your return along with any payment by check, cashier’s 
check, or money order.
Include a copy of your federal return (front and back) 
with your Oregon return. Include federal Schedules 1 
through 3 (if applicable), but don’t include other federal 
schedules unless otherwise instructed. Place it behind 
all Oregon forms and schedules.
Payment by check, cashier’s check, or money order 
should be placed on top of your return. Don’t mail cash. 
Don’t use a voucher. 
Don’t use staples, paper clips, tape, or other fasteners. 
Mail your return in a stamped envelope. Use a busi-
ness-size (4 × 9½ inches) or larger envelope with ade-
quate postage. Don’t use a smaller envelope—it delays 
processing.
