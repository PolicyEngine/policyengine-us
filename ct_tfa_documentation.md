**Once Enrolled**:

- 20% benefit reduction if earnings between 171-230% FPL

## Family Cap Policy

### Partial Family Cap

Connecticut is the **only state** that **partially limits** the increase in cash assistance for additional children born while receiving TFA.

**Policy Details**:
- Children born within **10 months** of a mother's application for assistance receive only **50%** of the additional cash benefit they would otherwise receive

**Effective Date**: 1995

**Exceptions to Family Cap**:
1. **Rape or incest**: Exceptions provided
2. **First child born to a minor dependent**: Not subject to cap

**Calculation Method**:

## Implementation Notes

### Data Gaps and Verification Needed

1. **Current Benefit Amounts (2024)**:
   - The most detailed benefit tables available are from July 1, 2014 (SSA POMS)
   - One source indicates family of 3 in Region A receives $833 (vs. $698 in 2014)
   - **Action Needed**: Verify current 2024 benefit amounts with Connecticut DSS
   - **Action Needed**: Obtain updated benefit schedule for all family sizes and regions

2. **Regional Town Assignments**:
   - Specific list of which towns/cities are in Regions A, B, and C not publicly available
   - Referenced in "Addendum A" of TANF State Plan
   - **Action Needed**: Obtain Addendum A from Connecticut DSS

3. **Asset Limit Update**:
   - Earlier sources cited $3,000, current sources cite $6,000
   - **Action Needed**: Verify effective date of change to $6,000 limit

4. **Benefit Calculation Formula**:
   - General framework documented (incremental method, family cap)
   - Specific calculation steps not fully detailed in available sources
   - **Action Needed**: Obtain UPM Section 8030.55 (Calculation of Benefits) full text

5. **Income Deductions and Exclusions**:
   - $90 initial application deduction confirmed
   - 100% earned income disregard up to FPL confirmed
   - Other potential deductions (work expenses, child care) not documented
   - **Action Needed**: Review full UPM Section 8030.30 (Treatment of Income)

### Regulatory Citations Needed

For full implementation, the following regulations should be obtained and reviewed:

1. **Connecticut Regulations of State Agencies (RCSA)**:
   - Title 17b regulations implementing TFA
   - Specific sections on benefit calculation, income treatment, asset limits

2. **Connecticut DSS Policy Issuances**:
   - Any policy transmittals or updates since 2014 affecting benefit amounts
   - Regional assignment updates

3. **Federal Regulations**:
   - 45 CFR Part 260-265 (TANF regulations)
   - As they apply to Connecticut's state plan

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Initial Eligibility - Family of 3

**Scenario**: Single parent with 2 children applies for TFA in Region A. Parent earns $1,000/month.

**Step 1: Determine Standard of Need**
- Household size: 3
- Standard of Need = 55% of FPL = $1,184/month (2024)

**Step 2: Calculate Countable Earned Income**
- Gross earnings: $1,000/month
- Initial application deduction: $90
- Countable earned income: $1,000 - $90 = $910/month

**Step 3: Compare to Standard of Need**
- Countable income ($910) < Standard of Need ($1,184)
- **Result: ELIGIBLE** for TFA (assuming meets other requirements)

**Step 4: Determine Benefit Amount** (using 2014 rates - verify current)
- Maximum benefit for family of 3, Region A: $698 (2014 rate)
- Note: Current rate may be $833 based on one 2024 source
- Benefit would be reduced based on countable income

### Example 2: Continuing Eligibility - Family of 4

**Scenario**: TFA recipient family of 4 in Region B. Adult gets job earning $2,800/month.

**Step 1: Determine Continuing Eligibility Limit**
- Household size: 4
- 100% FPL = $2,600/month

**Step 2: Compare Earnings**
- Earnings ($2,800) > 100% FPL ($2,600)
- Exceeds continuing eligibility limit

**Step 3: Apply Extension Rules** (Effective January 1, 2024)
- Family may continue receiving benefits for up to 6 months
- Earnings disregarded up to 230% FPL = $5,980/month for eligibility
- Earnings ($2,800) < 230% FPL ($5,980) ✓

**Step 4: Check for Benefit Reduction**
- Is $2,800 between 171% and 230% FPL?
- 171% FPL = $2,600 × 1.71 = $4,446
- $2,800 is NOT between $4,446 and $5,980
- **No benefit reduction applied**

**Result**: Family remains eligible for full TFA benefit during 6-month extension period.

### Example 3: Family Cap Application

**Scenario**: Family of 2 (parent + 1 child) receives TFA. Parent gives birth to second child 8 months after starting TFA.

**Without Family Cap** (hypothetical):
- Original benefit (family of 2, Region A): $563
- New benefit (family of 3, Region A): $698
- Increase: $698 - $563 = $135

**With Family Cap** (Connecticut policy):
- Child born within 10 months of application
- Receives only 50% of increase
- Actual increase: $135 × 0.5 = $67.50
- New benefit: $563 + $67.50 = $630.50

**Result**: Family receives $630.50 instead of $698 due to partial family cap.
