## Implementation Notes for Simplified PA TANF

### Core Components to Implement

1. **Benefit Calculation**:
   - Family Size Allowance (FSA) table by household size
   - Geographic variation (5 groups) - use Group 2 for simplified version
   - Benefit = FSA - countable income

2. **Income Calculation**:
   - Count gross earned and unearned income
   - Apply $90 initial work expense deduction
   - Apply 50% earned income disregard
   - Apply $200 additional work expense deduction
   - Subtract child care expenses (if applicable)
   - Result = countable income

3. **Eligibility Tests**:
   - Age: Child under 18 or 18 and in school
   - Deprivation: Parent absent, unemployed, incapacitated, or deceased
   - Income: Countable income < FSA
   - Resources: Assets ≤ $1,000
   - Citizenship/Residency
   - Time limit: < 60 months lifetime (or Extended TANF eligible)

4. **Special Rules**:
   - Pregnant women with no other children eligible
   - 50% disregard eligibility based on prior TANF receipt
   - Minor parent living arrangement requirements
   - Work requirement exemptions

### Data Sources for Parameters

- **Benefit amounts**: Use Group 2 (Philadelphia) FSA schedule
- **Effective date**: January 1, 1990 (benefits not updated since)
- **Deductions**: $90 initial + $200 additional work expenses
- **Resource limit**: $1,000
- **Time limit**: 60 months

### Testing Considerations

- Test families of various sizes (1-8 persons)
- Test with and without earned income
- Test 50% disregard application
- Test resource limit boundary cases
- Test special categories (pregnant women, students)
- Test time limit scenarios

---

## Research Gaps and Questions

### Items Requiring Further Investigation

1. **Geographic Groups 1, 3, 4, 5**:
   - Which counties belong to each group?
   - What are current FSA amounts for Groups 1, 3, 4, 5?
   - Source: Need to access 55 Pa. Code Chapter 183, Appendix B, Table 3 directly

2. **Resource Limit Discrepancy**:
   - Is limit $1,000 or $10,000?
   - When did it change (if applicable)?
   - Source: Need current CAO guidance or recent regulation updates

3. **Work Expense Deduction Details**:
   - Order of operations for $90 vs $200 deductions
   - Are both deductions cumulative?
   - Source: Need Policy Manual Section 160.2 (site timeout)

4. **Extended TANF Specifics**:
   - Detailed hardship track criteria
   - Application process
   - Benefit calculation differences
   - Source: Policy Manual Section 135.8 (site timeout)

5. **Minor Parent Living Arrangement Exemptions**:
   - Specific circumstances for exemptions
   - Documentation requirements
   - Source: Policy Manual Section 105.2 (site timeout)

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Contact Pennsylvania DHS directly for:
   - Current FSA table with all 5 geographic groups
   - Clarification on resource limit ($1,000 vs $10,000)
   - County assignments for geographic groups

2. Request from County Assistance Office:
   - Most recent policy manual sections (if online access unavailable)
   - Any internal bulletins or updates since 2020

3. Alternative access methods:
   - Pennsylvania state library for printed regulations
   - Legal aid organizations for current guidance documents
   - Use Pennsylvania Public Records Request for policy documents

## Change Log

### Benefit Increases Over Time

- **January 1, 1990**: Current benefit levels established
- **September 26, 2020**: Additional $200 work expense deduction added
- **No increases in FSA amounts since 1990** (over 34 years)

### Purchasing Power Analysis

A family of three's benefit has declined from:
- **1990**: 43% of Federal Poverty Level
- **2021**: 22% of Federal Poverty Level
- **2024**: 17-22% of Federal Poverty Level (depending on source)

This represents approximately **50% loss in purchasing power** over 34 years.

- Resource limits: **MEDIUM** (conflicting information on $1,000 vs $10,000)
- Geographic variations: **LOW** (only Group 2 amounts confirmed)
- Extended TANF details: **MEDIUM** (general structure known, details incomplete)

**Next Agent**: Implementation Agent can proceed with Group 2 benefit amounts and core eligibility rules. Geographic variation can be added in future enhancement.
