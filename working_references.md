## 5. Benefit Calculation

### 5.1 Budgeting Method

**Method**: Fill-the-Gap Budgeting

**Description**: TDHS continues to use fill-the-gap budgeting when determining benefit amounts. The benefit is calculated by subtracting countable income (after applying disregards) from the Consolidated Need Standard to determine the actual payment amount.

**Source**: Tennessee State Plan 2024-2027, NCCP Tennessee TANF Profile

### 5.2 Maximum Benefit Amounts

**Regulatory Citation**: Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-01-50-.20

**Standard Payment Amount (SPA)**: Tennessee does not meet 100% of need as defined by the consolidated need standard. Rather, a maximum payment by family size, dependent on available State and Federal funds is paid.

**Calculation**: The Families First standard payment amount (maximum payment) for an assistance group of three (3) persons represents 25.0% of the consolidated need for an assistance group of that size.

**Standard Payment Amount (SPA) by Assistance Group Size**:

| Assistance Group Size | Consolidated Need Standard (CNS) | SPA (25% of CNS) | DGPA |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|------|
| 1 | $976 | $244 | $344 |
| 2 | $1,370 | $343 | $443 |
| 3 | $1,549 | $387 | $487 |
| 4 | $1,752 | $438 | $538 |
| 5 | $1,885 | $471 | $571 |
| 6+ | Increases by size | Per formula | Equal to SPA |

**Note**: The $387 benefit for a family of 3 was increased from $277 in 2021.

**Source**: Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-01-50-.20 (Cornell Law), Tennessee State Plan 2024-2027, NCCP Tennessee TANF Profile

### 5.3 Differential Grant Payment Amount (DGPA)

**Regulatory Citation**: Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-01-50-.20

**Description**: Families First assistance groups that meet certain criteria are eligible for a grant based on the Differential Grant Payment Amount (DGPA). The DGPA is a maximum payment by family size, dependent on funds available.

**Qualifying Criteria**:
- Caretaker is age 60 or older
- Caretaker is disabled
- Caretaker provides in-home care for a disabled family member
- No eligible adults are present in the assistance group

**Source**: Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-01-50-.20 (Cornell Law)

### 5.4 Minimum Monthly Grant

**Regulatory Citation**: Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-01-50-.20

**Amount**: The minimum monthly grant which can be paid is $10.00.

**Source**: Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-01-50-.20

### 5.5 Payment Calculation Formula

**Regulatory Citation**: Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-01-50-.20

**Formula**: The monthly grant equals "the smaller of a maximum payment amount by family size (SPA or DGPA, as appropriate) or the deficit if it is ten dollars ($10) or more."

**Process**:
1. Calculate gross countable income
2. Apply income disregards and deductions
3. Calculate net countable income
4. Subtract net countable income from CNS to determine deficit
5. Payment = minimum of (maximum payment amount, deficit)
6. Payment must be at least $10 or no payment is made

**Source**: Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1240-01-50-.20 (Cornell Law)

### 5.6 Payment Schedule

**Schedule**: Payments are made available on the first (1st) of each month for continuously eligible cases.

## 13. Implementation Notes for PolicyEngine

### Key Implementation Considerations

1. **Benefit Calculation Structure**:
   - Use fill-the-gap method
   - Apply income disregards in specific order
   - Calculate CNS-based eligibility
   - Determine SPA vs DGPA eligibility
   - Apply minimum benefit threshold ($10)

2. **Parameter Files Needed**:
   - CNS by family size (updates annually)
   - GIS (185% of CNS)
   - SPA by family size (25% of CNS)
   - DGPA by family size
   - Income disregard amounts ($250 earned income)
   - Child care deduction amounts ($200/$175)
   - Resource limit ($2,000)
   - Vehicle exemption ($4,600)

3. **Variable Structure**:
   - Eligibility variables (age, residency, citizenship, resource test, income test)
   - Income calculation variables (earned, unearned, total)
   - Deduction variables (earned income disregard, child care)
   - Benefit amount variables (SPA, DGPA, actual benefit)

4. **Testing Priorities**:
   - Fill-the-gap calculation accuracy
   - Income disregard application order
   - SPA vs DGPA determination
   - Minimum benefit threshold
   - Edge cases (income just above/below limits)

5. **Similar State Implementations**:
   - Review existing state TANF implementations in PolicyEngine US
   - Compare with Washington TANF, Pennsylvania TANF, Ohio OWF implementations
   - Follow established patterns for state-specific TANF programs
