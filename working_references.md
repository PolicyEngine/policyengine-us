## Income Calculation

### Earned Income Treatment

**Source**: WAC 388-450-0170
**Effective Date**: August 1, 2024

Washington applies a two-step process to calculate countable earned income:

#### Step 1: Family Earnings Disregard
**Amount**: $500 per month
**Application**: Deduct the first $500 of the total household's gross earned income

#### Step 2: 50% Work Incentive
**Rate**: 50% of remaining income
**Application**: After the $500 disregard, subtract 50% of the remaining monthly gross earned income

#### Calculation Formula

```
Countable Earned Income = (Gross Earned Income - $500) × 0.5
```

#### Example Calculation

```
Gross Earned Income:           $1,800
Less: Family Earnings Disregard: -$500
Remaining Income:              $1,300
Work Incentive (÷ 2):            ÷ 2
Countable Earned Income:         $650
```

**Citation**: WAC 388-450-0170
**URL**: https://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=388-450-0170

### Unearned Income Treatment

**Source**: WAC 388-450-0025, WAC 388-450-0162

**Definition**: Income received from sources other than employment or self-employment.

**Calculation Process**:
1. Calculate total earned income with disregards (as above)
2. Add all unearned income (no disregards apply to most unearned income)
3. Total countable income = Countable earned income + Unearned income

**Types of Unearned Income**:
- Social Security benefits
- Child support payments (with specific exclusions for TANF recipients)
- SSI payments
- Pension payments
- Unemployment compensation
- Workers' compensation
- Tribal payments (unless specifically excluded)

**Excluded Unearned Income**:
- Child support received by TANF/SFA recipients (legally obligated payments)
- Federal tax refunds and EITC (in month received)
- Foster care maintenance payments
- One-time VOLAG (Voluntary Agency) payments
- SSI payments (recipients cannot receive TANF)

### Dependent Care Deductions

| 41-80 hours       | $100             | $87.50                            |
| 81-120 hours      | $150             | $131.25                           |
| 121+ hours        | $200             | $175.00                           |

**Conditions**:
- Must be verified dependent care expenses
- Caregiver cannot be the parent or stepparent of the child
- Deductions are prorated based on eligibility dates

```

## Implementation Notes for PolicyEngine

### Key Variables to Implement

1. **Payment Standards**: By household size (1-10+ persons)
2. **Income Limits**: Maximum gross earned income by household size
3. **Earned Income Calculation**:
   - $500 flat disregard
   - 50% of remaining earned income
4. **Resource Limit**: $12,000
5. **Dependent Care Deductions**: By work hours and child age
6. **Time Limits**: 60-month lifetime limit (tracking not required for simplified implementation)
7. **Assistance Unit Rules**: Who must be included/excluded

### Simplifications for Initial Implementation

Based on issue #6819 and PR #6818 requesting a "simplified TANF implementation":

**May Exclude** (for simplified version):
- WorkFirst participation tracking
- Sanction tracking and progression
- Time limit tracking (note limit exists but don't track months used)
- Individual Responsibility Plan requirements
- Hardship extension determination
- Indian Country exemption
- Pregnant Women Assistance (PWA) - separate program

**Must Include**:
- Payment standards
- Income limits and calculations (earned and unearned)
- Earned income disregards ($500 + 50%)
- Resource limits
- Basic assistance unit composition rules
- Basic eligibility requirements

### Testing Scenarios

Recommended test cases:
1. Single parent with 2 children, no income
2. Single parent with 2 children, earned income below limit
3. Two-parent household with 3 children, one parent working
4. Household at income limit boundary
5. Household with dependent care expenses
6. Household with unearned income

## Notes and Clarifications

### $500 Family Earnings Disregard
The $500 family earnings disregard became effective **August 1, 2024**. This replaced any previous earnings disregard structure. This is a flat amount deducted from total household earned income before applying the 50% work incentive.

### Resource Limit Change
The resource limit increased from $6,000 to $12,000 on **February 1, 2024**, representing a 100% increase to help families build savings while receiving assistance.

### Maximum Grant Cap
Despite payment standards going up to $1,662 for families of 10+, there is a **maximum grant cap of $1,338** that applies to assistance units with 8 or more members.

### State vs. Federal Programs
- **TANF**: Federal and state funded, 60-month lifetime limit
- **SFA (State Family Assistance)**: State-funded, same rules as TANF, counts toward 60-month limit
- **PWA (Pregnant Women Assistance)**: State-funded, for those ineligible for TANF/SFA
- **RCA (Refugee Cash Assistance)**: For refugees, same payment standards

### Income Treatment Summary
```
Gross Earned Income
- $500 (Family Earnings Disregard)
= Remaining Earned Income
× 0.5 (50% Work Incentive)
= Countable Earned Income

Countable Earned Income
+ Unearned Income (no disregards)
= Total Countable Income

Payment Standard (by family size)
- Total Countable Income
= TANF Grant Amount (max $1,338)
```
