## 5. Benefit Calculation Methodology

### Eligibility Determination

**Step 1: Gross Income Test**
- Compare household gross income to Gross Income Ceiling (GIC) for AU size
- If gross income > GIC, family is ineligible

**Step 2: Resource Test**
- Countable resources must be ≤ $1,000
- Vehicle value must be ≤ $4,650

**Step 3: Calculate Countable Earned Income**

From gross earned income, subtract:
1. **Standard Work Expense:** $250 per employed individual
2. **Dependent Care Expenses** (from countable income):
   - Up to $200/month per child under age 2
   - Up to $175/month per child age 2+ or incapacitated adult

Add all unearned income (after applicable exclusions)

**Note:** Georgia does NOT use the traditional AFDC $30 + 1/3 earned income disregard

**Step 4: Net Income Test**
- Compare countable income to Standard of Need (SON)
- If countable income ≥ SON, family is ineligible

**Step 5: Benefit Calculation**
- Benefit = MIN(SON - Countable Income, Family Maximum)
- Benefit cannot exceed Family Maximum for AU size

### Example Calculation: Family of 3

**Scenario:** Mother with 2 children, $500/month earned income, $100/month child support, no other income

**Calculation:**
1. Gross earned income: $500
2. Standard work expense: -$250
3. Countable earned income: $500 - $250 = $250
4. Add unearned income (child support): +$100
5. Total countable income: $350
6. Standard of Need for 3: $424
7. Benefit before max: $424 - $350 = $74
8. Family Maximum for 3: $280
9. **Final Benefit: $74/month**

**Note:** If gross earned income were $700/month or higher, countable income would exceed the Standard of Need and family would be ineligible for cash benefits.

| **Maximum Benefit (Family of 3)** | $280/month |

## 10. Implementation Notes

### For Simple Implementation
The basic implementation should focus on:

1. **Income Eligibility:** Gross Income Ceiling test (185% × Standard of Need)
2. **Resource Test:** $1,000 limit
3. **Benefit Calculation:** MIN(SON - Countable Income, Family Maximum)
4. **Earned Income Deductions:** $250 work expense only (no additional disregards)
5. **Dependent Care:** $200 (under 2) or $175 (2+) per child

### Complexities Not Yet Addressed
- Two-parent family workforce connection requirements
- Specific hardship extension criteria
- Sanction reduction calculations
- Minor parent budgeting rules (Section 1624)
- Sponsored alien income budgeting (Section 1632)
- Lump sum income budgeting (Section 1650)
- Income and Eligibility Verification System (IEVS) integration (Section 1405)
- State-specific variations in P-TANF (Grandparents Raising Grandchildren)

### Missing Documentation
The following items need further investigation:
1. **Complete PAMMS Section 1615:** Full text of deductions policy (currently accessible only via PDF)
2. **Benefit Calculation Examples:** Official worked examples from DFCS
3. **Historical Parameter Values:** Pre-March 2025 values for GIC, SON, Family Maximum
4. **State Plan Details:** Full text extraction from PDF state plans
5. **Specific Regulation Text:** Complete text of 290-2-28-.13 (Financial Eligibility)

---

## 11. Questions for Clarification

1. **✅ RESOLVED - Earned Income Disregard:** Initial document incorrectly included AFDC-era $30 + 1/3 disregard. Georgia currently uses only $250 standard work expense deduction per PAMMS Section 1615 and 1605. Previous reference to "$90 work expense" was incorrect.

2. **✅ RESOLVED - Income Ceiling Formula:** Confirmed GIC = 185% × Standard of Need per Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. 290-2-28-.02(j). Implementation uses formula-based calculation, not hardcoded table.

3. **Vehicle Limit:** Vehicle value limit of $4,650 cited on eligibility page but not modeled in simplified implementation (resource test uses cash assets only)

4. **P-TANF vs Regular TANF:** Are benefit calculations identical for P-TANF (Grandparents Raising Grandchildren) or are there differences beyond income limits?

5. **Child Support Treatment:** Section 1610 mentions child support uses "last three months of receipts" for representative amount. Is this unearned income, and are there any disregards?
