### Calculation Formulas

#### Income Eligibility Test
```python
# Texas uses 150% FPL
fpl_limit = federal_poverty_level[household_size] * 1.5
eligible = household_income <= fpl_limit
```

#### Benefit Calculation (Simplified)
```python
# Step 1: Calculate energy burden
energy_burden = annual_energy_costs / annual_household_income

# Step 2: Determine priority points
priority_points = 0
if age >= 60: priority_points += 20
if disabled: priority_points += 20
if has_child_under_6: priority_points += 20
if energy_burden > 0.10: priority_points += 30
if income < (fpl * 0.75): priority_points += 30

# Step 3: Calculate base benefit
base_benefit = min(200 + (priority_points * 10), 1000)

# Step 4: Apply household size adjustment
smi_adjustment = [0.52, 0.68, 0.84, 1.00, 1.16, 1.32]  # for sizes 1-6
if household_size > 6:
    adjustment = 1.32 + (0.03 * (household_size - 6))
else:
    adjustment = smi_adjustment[household_size - 1]
    
adjusted_benefit = base_benefit * adjustment

# Step 5: Apply caps
final_benefit = min(adjusted_benefit, 12300)
```

#### Crisis Assistance Eligibility
```python
crisis_eligible = (
    has_shutoff_notice or
    past_due_amount > 0 or
    broken_equipment or
    fuel_tank_empty or
    other_emergency
)
crisis_benefit = min(amount_needed_to_resolve, 2400)
```
