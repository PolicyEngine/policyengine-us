| 4          | $707            | $660              |
| 5          | $822            | $822              |
| 6          | $981            | $981              |
| 7          | $1,072          | $1,072            |
| 8+         | Add $95 for each additional person | Add $95 for each additional person |

**Key Notes:**
- "Eligible Grantee" standard applies when the adult (grantee) is a member of the program group
- "Ineligible Grantee" standard applies when the adult is not part of the assistance group (e.g., SSI recipients)
- Payment standards have been frozen since October 1, 2008
- The 1993 maximum benefit for a family of three was $459; adjusted for inflation, the 2024 value is equivalent to only $242

### 2.2 Historical Payment Standards

**October 1, 2008**: Payment standards set at current levels
- Family of 3: $492 (now $583 for eligible grantee as of 2025)

**1993**: Maximum FIP benefit for family of three was $459

### 2.3 Supplemental Payments

---

## 3. INCOME ELIGIBILITY LIMITS

### 3.1 Income Test for Initial Eligibility

**Maximum Countable Earned Income for Family of Three**: $814/month

**Formula Derivation**:
The $814 figure is derived from the payment standard plus the earned income disregard:
- Apply earned income disregard: $200 + 20% of remainder
- Starting from payment standard of $583 (for family of 3)
- Working backwards: Maximum eligible income = Payment standard / (1 - 0.20) + $200
- This establishes effective income limit at $814 for initial eligibility

**Deep Poverty Threshold**:
- Since 2017, families must be in "deep poverty" (below 50% of federal poverty line) to qualify
- In 2023, the income limit represented approximately 39% of the poverty line for a family of three

### 3.2 Ongoing Eligibility

**Maximum Countable Earned Income for Family of Three**: $1,184/month

**Formula**:
- Uses more generous earned income disregard: $200 + 50% of remainder
- Maximum eligible income = $1,184 for ongoing eligibility

---

## 4. INCOME COUNTING RULES

### 4.1 Earned Income Disregards

**Source**: BEM 518, Michigan TANF State Plan 2023

#### Initial Eligibility
- **Disregard**: $200 + 20% of remainder of earnings
- **Applied to**: Each employed person in the household
- **Purpose**: Determine if family qualifies for FIP

#### Ongoing Eligibility (Benefit Calculation)
- **Disregard**: $200 + 50% of remainder of earnings
- **Effective Date**: Changed to 50% in 2011 (previously was 20%)
- **Applied to**: Each employed person when calculating benefit amount
- **Purpose**: Calculate monthly benefit amount for currently enrolled families

**Example Calculation for Family of 3**:
```
Scenario: Family has $1,000 in earned income
Step 1: Apply disregard: $200 + (50% × $800) = $200 + $400 = $600
Step 2: Countable income: $1,000 - $600 = $400
Step 3: Benefit = Payment Standard - Countable Income = $583 - $400 = $183
```

### 4.2 Unearned Income

**Source**: BEM 503

#### Generally Countable Unearned Income:
- **RSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance)**: Gross amount counted
- **Retirement Income**: Counted
- **Veterans Benefits**: Generally counted
- **Unemployment Compensation**: Counted
- **Workers Compensation**: Counted

#### Special Treatment:
- **SSI (Supplemental Security Income)**: SSI recipients are typically ineligible grantees
- **Child Support**: Certified support counted only in FIP support income test
- **Child Support Pass-Through**: Up to $50/month returned to FIP households from collected child support

#### Income Exclusions:
- Income of non-group members excluded
- Certain vendor payments excluded
- Educational grants/scholarships (with limitations)

### 4.3 Self-Employment Income

### 5.4 Asset Exemptions

Specific asset exemptions are detailed in BEM 400, including:
- Primary residence (typically exempt)
- One vehicle (with equity limitations)

**Source**: BEM 210

The following individuals **must** be included in the FIP group:
- Children under 18 living in the home
- Their caretaker(s)
- Spouses of caretakers (with limited exceptions)

### 6.2 Primary Caretaker Determination

## 7. TIME LIMITS

### 7.1 Lifetime Benefit Limit

**Current Limit (through March 31, 2025)**: 48 months

---

## 9. BENEFIT CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

### 9.1 General Formula

**Basic Formula**:
```
Monthly FIP Benefit = Payment Standard - Countable Income
```

**Components**:
1. **Payment Standard**: Determined by household size and grantee eligibility status (RFT 210)
2. **Countable Income**: Gross income minus applicable disregards (BEM 518)

### 9.2 Calculation Steps (Ongoing Cases)

**Source**: BEM 520, BEM 518, BEM 515

1. **Determine Group Composition** (BEM 210)
   - Identify all mandatory and optional group members
   - Determine payment standard category (eligible vs. ineligible grantee)

2. **Calculate Gross Income** (BEM 500, 503)
   - Count all earned income
   - Count all countable unearned income
   - Exclude income of non-group members

3. **Apply Earned Income Disregard** (BEM 518)
   - For ongoing cases: $200 + 50% of remainder
   - Apply separately for each working person

4. **Calculate Countable Income**
   - Subtract disregards from gross income
   - This is the income counted against payment standard

5. **Calculate Benefit Amount** (BEM 520)
   - Payment Standard (from RFT 210) minus Countable Income
   - If result is negative or zero, family is ineligible

6. **Add Supplemental Payments** (if applicable)
   - Young child supplement
   - Clothing allowance

### 9.3 Initial Eligibility Calculation

Same as above, but uses **20% disregard** instead of 50% disregard for determining initial eligibility.

### 9.4 Support Income Test

**Source**: BEM 518

A separate test applies for child support income. Certified child support is counted only in the FIP support income test (distinct from general income test).

---

## 12. PROGRAM STATISTICS AND CONTEXT

### 12.1 Funding

**Michigan's TANF Block Grant**: $772.8 million (FY 2022)
- Amount appropriated to MDHHS: $528.1 million

### 12.2 Inflation-Adjusted Value

**Purchasing Power Decline**:
- 1993: Maximum benefit for family of 3 = $459
- 2008: Maximum benefit for family of 3 = $492 (now $583 with new table)
- Inflation-adjusted 2024 value of 1993 benefit: $242
- Real value has declined approximately 47% since 1993

### 12.3 Poverty Level Context

**Income Eligibility as Percent of Federal Poverty Level**:
- 2017: Families must be below 50% of poverty line
- 2023: Income limit represents approximately 39% of poverty line for family of 3
- This represents "deep poverty" - one of the most restrictive TANF programs in the nation

---

## 13. KEY IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### 13.1 For Simplified TANF Implementation

Based on this research, a simplified Michigan TANF implementation should include:

1. **Payment Standards by Household Size** (RFT 210 tables)
2. **Income Eligibility Test**:
   - Initial: Countable income ≤ derived threshold (e.g., $814 for family of 3)
   - Ongoing: More generous threshold (e.g., $1,184 for family of 3)
3. **Earned Income Disregard**:
   - Initial: $200 + 20% of remainder
   - Ongoing: $200 + 50% of remainder
4. **Asset Test**: $15,000 limit
5. **Benefit Calculation**: Payment Standard - Countable Income

### 13.2 Simplifying Assumptions for PolicyEngine

For a simplified implementation, the following assumptions are reasonable:
- Use "eligible grantee" payment standards (most common scenario)
- Count gross earned income minus disregard
- Count gross unearned income (with major exclusions)
- Assume no stepparent deeming complications
- Use standard household composition (no SSI recipients complicating eligibility)
- Ignore time limits (cannot be modeled in cross-sectional analysis)
- Ignore work requirements (behavioral, not calculable)
