**Income Conversion**:
- Weekly × 4.3
- Biweekly × 2.15
- Semimonthly × 2

### Step 2: Apply Income Exclusions (per OAC 5101:1-23-20.1)

**Excluded Earned Income**:
- All SNAP exclusions
- Dependent student earnings (except parents)
- Child support paid for children outside household
- Garnished amounts
- EITC
- Census employment

**Excluded Unearned Income**:
- SSI payments
- Foster care payments
- Housing assistance
- Utility assistance
- And 17 other categories

### Step 3: Apply Income Allocation (if applicable, per OAC 5101:1-23-20.2)

For stepparents, minor caretaker parents, spouses of specified relatives, or non-citizen parents:

1. Start with earned income
2. Subtract first $90
3. Add unearned income
4. Subtract allocation allowance (100% of July 1, 1997 FPL for dependents not in group)
5. Subtract ongoing support payments
6. Subtract alimony or child support paid
7. Remainder = countable allocated income

### Step 4: Apply Earned Income Disregard (per ORC 5107.10)

For ongoing eligibility:
1. Gross earned income
2. Minus $250
3. Minus 50% of remainder
4. = Countable earned income

**Note**: Disregard NOT applied if assistance group failed without good cause to make timely earnings report.

### Step 5: Calculate Total Countable Income

Countable Earned Income + Countable Unearned Income = Total Countable Income

---

## Benefit Calculation

### Formula (per OAC 5101:1-23-40)

**OWF Payment = Payment Standard - Total Countable Income**

### Example Calculation

**Scenario**: Family of 3 with $800 gross monthly earned income, no unearned income

1. Gross earned income: $800
2. Apply earned income disregard:
   - $800 - $250 = $550
   - $550 × 0.50 = $275
   - Countable earned income = $550 - $275 = $275
3. Total countable income: $275
4. Payment standard (family of 3): $623
5. **OWF benefit: $623 - $275 = $348**

### Minimum Benefit

OWF shall not be authorized when the amount is at least $1 but less than $10 per month.

### Maximum Benefit

Cannot exceed the payment standard for assistance group size.

### Ineligibility

The assistance group is ineligible when countable income equals or exceeds the payment standard.

### Summary of Impact

**Documentation Completeness**: Despite inability to extract PDFs, comprehensive documentation was successfully gathered from authoritative HTML sources including:
- Ohio Revised Code (statutes)
- Ohio Administrative Code (regulations)
- ODJFS website and county DJFS websites
- Federal Register archives (for 1997 FPG)

- Detailed program implementation examples from Legal Aid materials

**Conclusion**: The HTML-based documentation is sufficient for simplified TANF implementation in PolicyEngine US. The core legal framework, eligibility rules, income calculation methods, and benefit formulas are fully documented. The main limitation is the incomplete payment standards table, which can be addressed by:
1. Contacting ODJFS directly when eManuals website is restored
2. Interpolating values for missing family sizes using confirmed data points
3. Using county-specific data as available

---

## Additional Research Needed

### 1. Complete Payment Standards Table

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Only family of 3 confirmed ($623 as of Nov 2024)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Needed**: Complete table for all family sizes (1-10+)
**Source**: ODJFS Cash Assistance Manual or Action Change Transmittal Letters
**URL**: http://emanuals.jfs.ohio.gov/CashFoodAssist/CAM/ACT/ (currently unavailable due to maintenance)
**Alternative**: Contact ODJFS at (866) 244-0071 or individual county DJFS offices

**For Implementation**: Can proceed with interpolation or use alternative sources once eManuals becomes available

---

### 2. Federal Poverty Guidelines (July 1, 1997)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Source**: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
**Retrieved**: November 4, 2025
**URL**: https://aspe.hhs.gov/1997-hhs-poverty-guidelines

Complete tables obtained for:
- 48 Contiguous States and DC
- Alaska
- Hawaii
- Including formulas for families with 8+ members

---

### 3. Income Limit Calculation Methodology

**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Issue**: Reported income limit for family of 3 ($1,076) is higher than 50% of 1997 FPL ($555.42)

**Possible Explanations**:
1. Additional disregards applied before comparison to 50% threshold
2. Different calculation methodology in practice vs. statute
3. Confusion between gross income limit and countable income limit

**Action Needed**: Review OAC regulations and contact ODJFS for clarification on exact calculation process for initial eligibility determination

---

### 4. Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) History

**Status**: ❌ NOT OBTAINED
**Priority**: LOW (for simplified implementation)
**Needed**: Historical COLA adjustments for payment standards
**Purpose**: Understanding benefit level trends and forecasting
**Source**: ODJFS Action Change Transmittal Letters
**URL**: http://emanuals.jfs.ohio.gov/CashFoodAssist/CAM/ACT/ (currently unavailable)

**Note**: Not critical for current implementation but useful for historical analysis

---

### 5. County-Level Variation

**Status**: ❌ NOT RESEARCHED
**Priority**: LOW (for simplified implementation)
**Needed**: Determine if any county-level discretion exists in implementation
**Focus**: Work requirement modifications, hardship exemptions, support services

**Initial Assessment**: Program appears to be statewide with uniform rules, but counties have discretion in:
- Hardship exemptions (up to 20% of caseload)
- Support services
- Good cause determinations

**For Implementation**: Use statewide rules only; county variations not modeled

---

### 6. Self-Sufficiency Contract Template

**Status**: ❌ NOT OBTAINED
**Priority**: LOW (not needed for benefit calculation)
**Needed**: Standard contract form and requirements
**Source**: ODJFS JFS Forms
**URL**: https://emanuals.jfs.ohio.gov/CashFoodAssist/CAM/JFSForms/ (currently unavailable)

**Note**: Contract requirements documented in regulations; actual form not needed for PolicyEngine implementation

---

## Implementation Notes for PolicyEngine

### Key Variables to Implement

1. **Eligibility Variables**:
   - `oh_owf_eligible` - Overall eligibility determination
   - `oh_owf_categorically_eligible` - Household composition test
   - `oh_owf_income_eligible` - Income test (initial vs. ongoing)
   - `oh_owf_time_limit_eligible` - Time limit tracking (conceptual)

2. **Income Variables**:
   - `oh_owf_gross_earned_income` - Total earned income
   - `oh_owf_gross_unearned_income` - Total unearned income
   - `oh_owf_allocated_income` - Income from ineligible household members
   - `oh_owf_earned_income_disregard` - $250 + 50% of remainder
   - `oh_owf_countable_income` - Final countable income

3. **Benefit Variables**:
   - `oh_owf_payment_standard` - By family size
   - `oh_owf_benefit_amount` - Payment standard minus countable income

4. **Parameters Needed**:
   - Payment standards by family size (update annually)
   - Federal poverty guidelines (July 1, 1997 - static)
   - Earned income disregard amounts ($250, 50%)
   - Income allocation standard (1997 FPL - static)
   - Minimum benefit threshold ($10)

### Simplifications for Initial Implementation

1. **Time Limits**: Track conceptually but don't enforce in calculations (requires longitudinal data)
2. **Work Requirements**: Note in documentation but don't model compliance
3. **Sanctions**: Exclude from initial implementation (requires case history)
4. **Child Support Cooperation**: Assume cooperation for benefit calculations
5. **County-Level Variation**: Use statewide rules only

### Data Requirements

1. **Household Structure**: Need to identify minor children, parents, specified relatives
2. **Pregnancy Status**: Binary indicator (6+ months pregnant)
3. **Income Sources**: Separate earned and unearned income
4. **Family Size**: Count of assistance group members
5. **Age**: To determine minor child status (under 18, or 19 if in school)

### Testing Considerations

1. Create test cases for:
   - Single parent with children
   - Two-parent households
   - Pregnant women with no children
   - Minor parents living with their parents
   - Specified relative caretakers
   - Families with only earned income
   - Families with only unearned income
   - Families with mixed income sources
   - Families at income limit thresholds

2. Validate against:
   - Official examples (if available from ODJFS)
   - County benefit calculators (if available)
   - Real-world case studies from legal aid organizations
   - 1997 FPL threshold calculations

### Known Implementation Challenges

1. **Incomplete Payment Standards**: Only family of 3 confirmed; other sizes need interpolation or additional research
2. **Income Limit Discrepancy**: Reported limits don't match 50% of 1997 FPL calculation; methodology needs clarification
3. **eManuals Unavailable**: Primary source for detailed program operations is currently down for maintenance
4. **Income Allocation**: Complex rules for stepparents and other household members require careful implementation
5. **Initial vs. Ongoing Eligibility**: Different standards apply; need to track which applies
