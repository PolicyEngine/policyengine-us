    fixed:
      - Cap all state TANF benefit formulas to prevent negative countable income from inflating benefits above the payment standard. Fixes NC household size .sum() bug and adds min_() caps to 38 state programs (AL, AK, AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DC, FL, HI, IA, IL, IN, KS, LA, MA, MD, MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, ND, NE, NH, NJ, NM, NV, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC, SD, TX, UT, VT, WV, WY). Previously, negative countable income could produce benefits exceeding $1M per household, inflating total TANF microsimulation from $9B target to $17.9T.
      - Connect spm_unit_assets to spm_unit_cash_assets (SIPP-imputed liquid assets) so that state TANF resource eligibility tests can screen out asset-ineligible households.
