    - Add support for family tier rating in ACA premium calculations for New York and Vermont.
    
      In standard states, individual premium rates vary by age, and family premiums are calculated by summing individual premiums.
      
      New York and Vermont use a family tier rating system with standardized multipliers:
      
      New York tiers:
      - One Adult = 1.00
      - Two Adults = 2.00
      - One Adult and One or More Children = 1.70
      - Two Adults and One or More Children = 2.85
      - Child only = 0.412 (no adults)
      
      Vermont tiers:  
      - One Adult = 1.00
      - Two Adults = 2.00
      - One Adult and One or More Children = 1.93
      - Two Adults and One or More Children = 2.81
