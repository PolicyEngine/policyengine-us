- bump: patch
  changes:
    fixed:
      - Fixed GitHub Actions workflows to use `python -m coverage` instead of `coverage` directly to resolve command not found errors
      - Aligned PR and push workflows to use identical test commands for consistency
      - Updated both workflows to use Python 3.13
