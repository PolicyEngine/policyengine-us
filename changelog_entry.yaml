      - title: Fix VT capital gains exclusion for financial instruments
        description: >
          Vermont's 40% capital gains exclusion now correctly excludes financial
          instruments (stocks, bonds) from eligibility. Only the flat $5,000
          exclusion applies to these gains. Added new input variable
          long_term_capital_gains_on_assets_eligible_for_vt_exclusion for
          modeling the 40% exclusion on qualifying assets.
