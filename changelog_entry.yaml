- bump: patch
  changes:
    fixed:
      - Use `uv sync --extra dev` in CI to correctly install optional dev dependencies including coverage.
      - Improve selective test runner to only run tests for specific subfolders (states, congress, local) instead of entire parent directories.
      - Pin pandas to <3.0 to prevent StringDtype incompatibility with numpy.
