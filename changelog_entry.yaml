- bump: patch
  changes:
    fixed:
    - Updated CA CalWORKs, CO CCAP, NE Child Care, and NC SCCA to use *_before_lsr income variables to avoid circular dependency issues in microsimulation.
    - SNAP dependent care deduction now uses childcare_expenses (net of subsidies) instead of pre_subsidy_childcare_expenses.
