    - State-specific Medicaid takeup rates based on MACPAC enrollment targets vs modeled eligibility. Rates range from 58% (Utah) to 99% (Colorado), replacing the uniform 93% national rate.
    - Deprivation requirement parameter for Medicaid parent eligibility in non-expansion states (TX, FL, GA, etc.).
    - is_single_parent_household variable to determine if a person qualifies under Section 1931 deprivation rules.
    changed:
    - Medicaid parent eligibility (is_parent_for_medicaid_nfc) now checks deprivation requirement for non-expansion states, correctly excluding married parents who don't meet Section 1931 criteria.
