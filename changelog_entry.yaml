    fixed:
      - Fix student loan interest deduction eligibility (IRC § 221) to remove incorrect AOC eligibility requirement. The previous implementation required is_eligible_for_american_opportunity_credit to be true, but this is not a legal requirement. While § 221(d)(3) references § 25A(b)(3) for the definition of "eligible student", this refers to the student's status when the loan was originally taken out, not current-year AOC eligibility.
