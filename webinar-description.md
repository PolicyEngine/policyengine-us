# PolicyEngine's Isolated AI Agents: Safe Rules-as-Code Development

**Thursday, 2:00 PM ET / 11:00 AM PT**  
**Duration**: 60 minutes (45 min demo + 15 min Q&A)

## The Challenge with AI-Generated Rules-as-Code

When AI writes code for government benefit programs, how can we ensure it:
- Actually follows the law, not just passes tests?
- Doesn't hallucinate values or take shortcuts?
- Produces maintainable, auditable implementations?

## PolicyEngine's Solution: Isolated AI Agent Development

Join us for a live demonstration where we'll implement a state's LIHEAP (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program) from scratch using PolicyEngine's multi-agent AI system that enforces accuracy through isolation.

### How It Works

Watch as multiple AI agents work in complete isolation:
- **Document Collector**: Gathers official regulations and statutes
- **Test Creator**: Builds tests from regulations (never sees implementation)
- **Rules Engineer**: Writes code from regulations (never sees tests)
- **Reviewer**: Validates everything matches documentation

The agents cannot "teach to the test" or take shortcuts because they never see each other's work during development.

## Live Demo Agenda

1. **Select a Random State** - We'll pick a state's LIHEAP program we've never implemented
2. **Document Collection** - AI gathers statutes and program manuals
3. **Isolated Development** - Watch agents work in parallel without communication
4. **Verification Rounds** - See how issues are caught and fixed
5. **Final Validation** - Every value traced to authoritative sources

## Why This Matters

- **Government Agencies**: Deploy AI for rules-as-code with confidence
- **Software Teams**: Learn robust methodology for regulatory compliance
- **Citizens**: Get accurate benefit calculations from AI systems
- **AI Safety Community**: See practical isolation techniques in action

## Key Takeaways

- How isolation prevents AI from gaming tests or hallucinating values
- Practical techniques for implementing regulations with AI
- How to maintain complete audit trails to source documents
- Why multiple verification rounds catch errors humans miss
- How PolicyEngine ensures every parameter traces to law

## Who Should Attend

- Government technologists and policy analysts
- Software engineers working on rules-as-code
- AI researchers interested in safety and accuracy
- Compliance and audit professionals
- Anyone building AI systems for critical applications

## What Makes This Different

Traditional AI coding assistants can:
- ❌ Hardcode values to pass tests
- ❌ Hallucinate parameters
- ❌ Take shortcuts that break edge cases

PolicyEngine's isolated agents:
- ✅ Work from primary sources only
- ✅ Cannot see each other's work
- ✅ Must implement from first principles
- ✅ Create traceable, auditable code

## Registration Details

No prior knowledge of LIHEAP, PolicyEngine, or rules-as-code required. We'll explain everything as we build!
