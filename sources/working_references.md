## Benefit Calculation (400-19-110-20)

### Calculation Method (13-Step Process)

**Step 1**: Calculate monthly **gross earned income**

**Step 2**: Subtract **Standard Employment Expense Allowance** (greater of 27% or $180)

**Step 3**: Subtract **Time Limited Percentage (TLP)** disregard to get countable earned income

**Step 4**: Add **unearned income** to get total countable income

**Step 5**: Subtract **Non-Household Member Deduction** (if applicable for stepparent/minor parent budgeting)

**Step 6**: Subtract **Allowable Expenses** (child support payments, dependent care, health insurance premiums)

**Step 7**: Calculate **Total Standard of Need** = Basic Standard of Need + $45 Out of Home Allowance (if applicable)

**Step 8**: **Benefit Amount** = Total Standard of Need - Adjusted Net Income - Benefit Cap - Sanction Deductions

**Steps 9-13**: Add Special Items of Need, Kinship Care Supportive Services; subtract recoupments; add JOBS Supportive Services

### Formula Summary

```
Countable Earned Income = Gross Earned Income - max(0.27 * Gross Earned Income, $180) - (TLP% * remaining)
Total Countable Income = Countable Earned Income + Unearned Income
Adjusted Net Income = Total Countable Income - Allowable Expenses
Benefit = max(Standard of Need - Adjusted Net Income, 0) - Sanction Deductions
```

### Minimum Benefit

**Minimum benefit**: **$10.00**
- If calculated benefit is less than $10.00, no benefit is issued
- This minimum does NOT apply to JOBS Supportive Services

## Implementation Approach

### Use Federal Baseline For:

- [x] Demographic eligibility (age thresholds match federal: under 18/19 for students)
- [x] Immigration eligibility (follows federal PRWORA requirements with 5-year bar)
- [ ] Income sources - need state-specific review for earned/unearned income definitions

### State-Specific Variables Needed:

1. **nd_tanf_gross_earned_income** - or use federal tanf_gross_earned_income
2. **nd_tanf_standard_employment_expense_disregard** - greater of 27% or $180
3. **nd_tanf_time_limited_percentage_disregard** - 50% (assume first cycle)
4. **nd_tanf_countable_earned_income** - after both disregards
5. **nd_tanf_countable_income** - earned + unearned
6. **nd_tanf_income_eligible** - compare to 50% FPL
7. **nd_tanf_resources_eligible** - compare to asset limits
8. **nd_tanf_eligible** - combines all eligibility tests
9. **nd_tanf_maximum_benefit** - standard of need by household size (50% FPL)
10. **nd_tanf** - final benefit calculation

### Parameters Needed:

## Data Gaps / Items Needing Clarification

1. **Complete Standard of Need Table**: Need exact dollar amounts for each household size (1, 2, 3, 4, 5+)

2. **Time Limited Percentage (TLP) Schedule**: Need complete breakdown of how the percentage decreases over the 13-month cycle (50% for first X months, then what?)

3. **Employment Disregards Section 400-19-105-25**: Referenced in benefit calculation but not accessible online - contains TLP cycle details

4. **Asset Limits Confirmation**: The $3,000/$6,000/$25 figures need verification from primary source (N.D.A.C. 75-02-01.2)

5. **Child Support Pass-Through**: Need to confirm if North Dakota has a child support pass-through/disregard policy and the amount

6. **Dependent Care Deduction Maximum**: Policy mentions maximum amounts for dependent care deduction but specific dollar limits not found
