    Calculates how much income is deemed from an ineligible spouse to an SSI-eligible individual,
    under 20 CFR ยง416.1163. Steps:
      1. Subtract child allocations from spouse's unearned, then earned.
      2. Check if leftover is <= the difference (couple FBR - individual FBR). If so, no deeming.
      3. If leftover is > the FBR difference, combine the spouse's leftover with the individual's income
         and apply standard SSI income exclusions as if they were a couple. 
      4. The deemed amount is the difference between the "combined" countable income and the individual's
         countable income alone.
