    Georgia surplus tax rebate - a one-time tax rebate for tax year 2022.
    
    This rebate was authorized under Georgia Code ยง 48-7-20.2 as part of the
    state's distribution of budget surplus funds to taxpayers. The rebate was
    issued only for tax year 2022 and varied by filing status:
    
    - Single/Separate filers: $250
    - Head of Household: $375
    - Joint/Surviving Spouse: $500
    
    The rebate amount is set to $0 for all years after 2022, reflecting its
    one-time nature. This rebate was automatically distributed to eligible
    taxpayers who filed a 2022 Georgia tax return.
