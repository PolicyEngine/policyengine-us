        # LIMITATIONS AND MISSING IMPLEMENTATIONS:
        #
        # 1. PRIMARY RESIDENCE EXCLUSION (NOT IMPLEMENTED):
        #    - Should exclude gains from primary residence sales above threshold
        #    - Missing: Section 121 exclusion (amounts vary by filing status)
        #    - Missing: Property sale price tracking
        #    - Missing: Primary residence identification
        #    - Reason: PolicyEngine doesn't currently model detailed property sales
        #
        # 2. RETIREMENT ACCOUNT EXCLUSION (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED):
        #    - Current capital_gains variables should already exclude retirement distributions
        #    - Retirement distributions are typically handled separately as ordinary income
        #    - This exclusion should already be working correctly in the current model
        #
        # 3. LIVESTOCK EXCLUSION (NOT IMPLEMENTED):
        #    - Should exclude livestock gains if >50% income from farming/ranching
        #    - Missing: Farming/ranching income classification
        #    - Missing: Livestock vs other business asset identification
        #    - Reason: PolicyEngine doesn't track detailed business asset types
        #
        # 4. CONSERVATION EASEMENT EXCLUSION (NOT IMPLEMENTED):
        #    - Should exclude gains from land under conservation/agricultural/forest easements
        #    - Missing: Property easement status tracking
        #    - Missing: Land use classification system
        #    - Reason: Requires property-specific data not available in tax records
        #
        # 5. IRC ยง 179 BUSINESS PROPERTY EXCLUSION (NOT IMPLEMENTED):
        #    - Should exclude gains from property eligible for ยง 179 deduction
        #    - Missing: Business property classification
        #    - Missing: ยง 179 eligibility determination
        #    - Reason: Requires detailed business asset tracking
        #
        # 6. NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING EXCLUSION (NOT IMPLEMENTED):
        #    - Should exclude gains from affordable housing owned by nonprofits
        #    - Missing: Entity type identification (nonprofit vs individual)
        #    - Missing: Affordable housing property classification
        #    - Reason: PolicyEngine focuses on individual/household tax units
        #
        # CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION COVERS:
        # - Basic 2% surtax rate
        # - Federal AGI threshold for surtax
        # - Net capital gains calculation with loss limitations
        # - Retirement account exclusion (implicit in capital_gains variables)
        #
        # ACCURACY IMPACT:
        # - Will overstate surtax liability for taxpayers with excluded gain types
        # - Most significant overstatement likely from primary residence sales
        # - Business-related exclusions may affect fewer taxpayers but could be material
