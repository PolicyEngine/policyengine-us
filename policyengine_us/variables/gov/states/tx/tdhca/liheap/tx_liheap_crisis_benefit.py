    Calculates emergency LIHEAP assistance for households in energy crisis.
    
    Crisis Assistance Definition (42 U.S.C. 8624(c)):
    Emergency assistance for households facing:
    - Utility disconnection within 72 hours
    - Already disconnected utilities
    - Nearly depleted heating fuel (propane, oil)
    - Broken heating/cooling equipment
    - Other energy-related emergencies
    
    Benefit Calculation:
    Crisis Benefit = min(Actual Emergency Need, Maximum Crisis Benefit)
    Maximum Crisis Benefit: $1,400 per household per year
    
    Example 1 - Disconnection Notice:
    - Past due electric bill: $850
    - Disconnection scheduled in 48 hours
    - Crisis eligible: Yes
    - Crisis amount needed: $850
    - Crisis benefit: min($850, $1,400) = $850
    - Result: Full past due amount covered
    
    Example 2 - Large Arrearage:
    - Past due gas and electric: $2,100
    - Service already disconnected
    - Crisis eligible: Yes
    - Crisis amount needed: $2,100
    - Crisis benefit: min($2,100, $1,400) = $1,400
    - Result: Maximum assistance provided, household pays $700
    
    Example 3 - Broken AC in Summer:
    - AC repair estimate: $1,200
    - Temperature forecast: 105Â°F
    - Crisis eligible: Yes (health/safety threat)
    - Crisis amount needed: $1,200
    - Crisis benefit: min($1,200, $1,400) = $1,200
    - Result: Full repair cost covered
    
    Example 4 - Propane Tank Empty:
    - Propane refill cost: $450
    - Tank at 5% capacity in winter
    - Crisis eligible: Yes
    - Crisis amount needed: $450
    - Crisis benefit: min($450, $1,400) = $450
    - Result: Tank refilled completely
    
    Example 5 - No Crisis Situation:
    - Current on all utilities
    - Equipment functioning
    - Adequate fuel supply
    - Crisis eligible: No
    - Crisis benefit: $0
    - Result: May still receive regular LIHEAP benefit
    
    Crisis vs Regular Benefits:
    - Crisis: One-time emergency payment up to $1,400
    - Regular: Annual assistance based on household size
    - Can receive both in same year if eligible
    - Crisis paid directly to vendor/utility company
    
    Payment Method:
    - Paid directly to utility company or fuel vendor
    - Not paid to household
    - Resolves immediate emergency
    - May require documentation of crisis
    
    Edge Cases:
    - Multiple crises: Limited to $1,400 total per year
    - Partial payment: Household responsible for remainder
    - Equipment replacement: May require multiple funding sources
