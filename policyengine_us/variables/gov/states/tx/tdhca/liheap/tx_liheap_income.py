    Calculates total monthly countable household income for Texas LIHEAP eligibility.
    
    Countable Income Sources (45 CFR 96.85):
    Federal regulations require counting most sources of household income:
    
    1. Earned Income:
       - Employment wages and salaries
       - Self-employment income (net of business expenses)
    
    2. Unearned Income:
       - Social Security benefits (retirement, disability, survivors)
       - Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
       - TANF cash assistance
       - Unemployment compensation
       - Veterans benefits
       - Workers compensation
       - Pension and retirement income
    
    Income Calculation:
    - Annual income sources are divided by 12 for monthly average
    - All household members' income is included
    - Gross income before taxes (except self-employment uses net)
    
    Example 1 - Working Family:
    - Parent 1 employment: $36,000/year = $3,000/month
    - Parent 2 employment: $24,000/year = $2,000/month
    - Child support: Not counted (not in list)
    - Total monthly income: $5,000
    
    Example 2 - Retired Couple:
    - Person 1 Social Security: $1,400/month
    - Person 2 Social Security: $1,200/month
    - Person 1 pension: $6,000/year = $500/month
    - Total monthly income: $3,100
    
    Example 3 - Mixed Income Household:
    - Adult employment: $30,000/year = $2,500/month
    - SSI for disabled child: $914/month
    - TANF assistance: $300/month
    - Total monthly income: $3,714
    
    Example 4 - Unemployed Individual:
    - Unemployment benefits: $400/week Ã— 52 = $20,800/year = $1,733/month
    - SNAP benefits: Not counted (in-kind benefit)
    - Total monthly income: $1,733
    
    Example 5 - Self-Employed Household:
    - Self-employment net income: $48,000/year = $4,000/month
    - Social Security: $18,000/year = $1,500/month
    - Total monthly income: $5,500
    
    Excluded Income (not counted):
    - SNAP benefits (food assistance)
    - Housing assistance payments
    - Energy assistance from other programs
    - Child support payments (in Texas)
    - Gifts and loans
    
    Special Considerations:
    - Uses 12-month average to smooth seasonal variations
    - Self-employment uses net income after business expenses
    - All adult and child income in household is counted
    
    Related variables:
    - employment_income: Wages from employment
    - self_employment_income: Net business income
    - social_security: All SS benefit types
