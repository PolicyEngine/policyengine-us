# Example: Calculating a Household's Monthly SNAP Benefits
# Consider a family of three with one full-time, minimum-wage worker,
# two children, dependent care costs of $78 a month, and shelter costs of $993
# per month.

    # Consider a family of three
    spm_unit_size: 3
    # with one full-time, minimum-wage worker [...]
    # Step 1 - Gross Income:
    # The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour.
    # Full-time work at this level yields monthly earnings of $1,257.
    snap_earned_income: 1_257

    # Step 2 — Net Income for Shelter Deduction:
    # Subtract the standard deduction for a three-person household ($177)
    snap_standard_deduction: 177
    # the earnings deduction (20 percent times $1,257 or $251)
    snap_earned_income_deduction: 1_257 * 0.2
    # and the child care deduction ($78)
    snap_dependent_care_deduction: 78
    # The result is $751 (Countable Income A).
    snap_net_income_pre_shelter: 751
    # Step 3 — Shelter Deduction:
    # Begin with the shelter costs of $993.
    # Subtract half of Countable Income A (half of $751 is $376) for a result
    # of $617.
    # Because there is a shelter deduction cap of $597, the shelter deduction
    # for this household is $597. 
    snap_excess_shelter_expense_deduction: 597
    # Step 4 — Net Income:
    # Subtract the shelter deduction ($597) from Countable Income A ($751)
    # for a result of $154.
    snap_net_income: 154
    # Step 5 — Family’s Expected Contribution Toward Food:
    # 30 percent of the household’s net income ($154) is about $46.
    snap_expected_contribution: 154 * 0.3
    # Step 6 — SNAP Benefit:
    # The maximum benefit in 2022 for a family of three is $658.
    # The maximum benefit minus the household contribution ($658 minus $46)
    # equals about $612.
    snap_max_allotment: 658
    # The family’s monthly SNAP benefit is $612.
