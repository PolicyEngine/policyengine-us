# MSP uses individual (1 person) or couple (2 persons) FPL,
# not the full SPM unit size per 42 U.S.C. 1396d(p)
# 2024 FPL: individual = $15,060, couple = $20,440
# Note: Published limits are $20 higher (FPL + $20 exclusion built in)
# Our implementation applies $20 exclusion to income instead - mathematically equivalent
