# BEGIN : PolicyEngineUS test cases derived from TPC publication test cases

# Test PolicyEngineUS QBID calculations using the six tax units specified in
# Table 1 of this TPC publication: "Navigating the New Pass-Through Provisions:
# A Technical Explanation" by William G. Gale and Aaron Krupkin
# (January 31, 2018), which is available at this URL:

#
# In constructing the TPC publication tax units, assume that the taxpayer
# has business income in the form of S-corporation income and no earnings,
# and that the spouse has no business income and only wage earnings.
# Assume that the taxpayer's share of the S corporation W2 wages is always
# $20,000 and that the taxpayer's share of the S corporation property is
# always $90,000.
