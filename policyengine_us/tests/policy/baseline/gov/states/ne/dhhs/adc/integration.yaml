# Nebraska ADC (Aid to Dependent Children) Integration Tests
# Gap Budgeting Methodology:
#   Step 1: Net Earned Income = Gross Earned * (1 - 0.50) = Gross Earned * 0.50
#   Step 2: Gap = Need Standard - Net Earned Income
#   Step 3: Benefit = min(Gap, Payment Standard)
#   Step 4: Final Benefit = Benefit - Unearned Income
#   Step 5: Apply minimum payment ($10) if benefit > 0 but < $10
#
# Income Standards (July 2021):
#   Size 2: Need Standard = $741, Payment Standard = $408
#   Size 3: Need Standard = $881, Payment Standard = $485
#   Size 4: Need Standard = $1,021, Payment Standard = $562
