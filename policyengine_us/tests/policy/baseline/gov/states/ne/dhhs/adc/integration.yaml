# Nebraska ADC (Aid to Dependent Children) Integration Tests
# These tests verify the FULL calculation pipeline with all intermediate values.
#
# Gap Budgeting Methodology:
#   Step 1: Net Earned Income = Gross Earned * (1 - disregard_rate)
#           - Initial applicants: 20% disregard (countable = 80%)
#           - Ongoing recipients: 50% disregard (countable = 50%)
#   Step 2: Gap = Need Standard - Net Earned Income
#   Step 3: Benefit = min(Gap, Payment Standard)
#   Step 4: Final Benefit = Benefit - Unearned Income
#
# Income Standards (July 2021):
#   Size 2: Need Standard = $741, Payment Standard = $408
#   Size 3: Need Standard = $881, Payment Standard = $485
#   Size 4: Need Standard = $1,021, Payment Standard = $562
#
# NOTE: These tests model ONGOING recipients (is_tanf_enrolled: true)
#       who receive the 50% earned income disregard.
