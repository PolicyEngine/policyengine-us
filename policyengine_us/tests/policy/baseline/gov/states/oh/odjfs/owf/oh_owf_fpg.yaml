# Test Ohio OWF Federal Poverty Guideline with July 1 effective date
# For 2024-01 (January): month < 7, uses July 1, 2023 FPL
# 2023 FPL (contiguous US): first_person = $14,580, additional_person = $5,140
#
# NOTE: Cannot test July+ periods because PolicyEngine test system only supports
# 2024-01 (first month) or 2024 (whole year) formats. The July 1 effective date
# logic in the variable is correct, but tests must use January periods.
