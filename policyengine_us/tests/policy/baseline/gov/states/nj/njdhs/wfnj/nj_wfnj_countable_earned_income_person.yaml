# NOTE: The earned income disregard is based on months of employment, not calendar
# months. PolicyEngine cannot track employment duration, so we use calendar months
# as a proxy. The tiered disregards are defined in a bracket parameter:
#   - January (month 1): 100% disregard
#   - February-July (months 2-7): 75% disregard
#   - August-December (months 8-12): 50% disregard

- name: Case 1, January with 100% disregard.
  period: 2024-01
  input:

  output:
    # January (month 1): 100% disregard
    # 1_000 * (1 - 1.0) = 0

    # Annual countable income aggregated across 12 months:
    # - January (month 1): $1,000 * 0% = $0 (100% disregard)
    # - Feb-Jul (months 2-7): $1,000 * 25% * 6 = $1,500 (75% disregard)
    # - Aug-Dec (months 8-12): $1,000 * 50% * 5 = $2,500 (50% disregard)
    # Total: $0 + $1,500 + $2,500 = $4,000
