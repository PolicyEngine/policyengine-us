# NOTE: The earned income disregard is based on months of employment, not calendar
# months. PolicyEngine cannot track employment duration, so we use calendar months
# as a proxy. January = 100% disregard, Feb-Jul = 75%, Aug-Dec = 50%.
# Only January (2024-01) can be tested due to PolicyEngine's period format restrictions.
