  output:
    # Household income = $2,640.18 + $2,640.18 = $5,280.36
    # This is in the $5,201-$5,350 bracket which gives $78 credit
    # Previously, az_agi subtracted $4,200 in exemptions, giving only $1,080.36 income
    # which would incorrectly place it in the $0-$2,500 bracket for $502 credit
