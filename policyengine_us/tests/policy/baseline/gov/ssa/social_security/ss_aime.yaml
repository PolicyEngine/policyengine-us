# Tests for Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME)
# Using SSA example from: https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/retirebenefit1.html

- name: Person with no earnings history
  period: 2024
  input:
    age: 62
    ss_covered_earnings_this_year: 0
  output:
    ss_aime: 0

- name: Simple case - constant earnings for one year
  period: 2024
  input:
    age: 62
    employment_income:
      2024-01-01: 60_000
    # With only one year of earnings, AIME = $60,000 / 420 months (35 years * 12)
  output:
    ss_aime: 142.857  # $60,000 / 420 = 142.857...

- name: Worker with current year earnings only
  period: 2024
  input:
    age: 62
    employment_income:
      2024-01-01: 50_000
    # With only one year of earnings, AIME = $50,000 / 420 months
  output:
    ss_aime: 119.048  # $50,000 / 420 = 119.047...

# Note: Full AIME calculation requires:
# 1. Up to 35 years of earnings history
# 2. Wage indexing to age 60
# 3. Selection of highest 35 years
# 4. Division by 420 months
# These tests will be expanded once period-spanning is implemented
