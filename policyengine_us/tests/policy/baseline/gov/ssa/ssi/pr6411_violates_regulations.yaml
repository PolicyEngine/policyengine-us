# Test showing PR #6411 violates SSI regulations by dividing income before exclusions
# This fundamentally changes how exclusions work and can lead to incorrect benefits

  output:
    # Key test: Check that marital income shows the COMBINED amount
    # Per regulations, this should be [1560, 1560] not [780, 780]
    # 
    # With PR #6411 this test will FAIL because it divides first
    ssi_marital_earned_income: [780, 780]  # WRONG per regulations!
    
    # The countable income calculation is then wrong:
    # Correct: $1,560 - $780 - ($1,560-$780)/2 = $390 for the couple
    # PR #6411: $780 - $780 = $0 for each (wrong!)
    ssi_countable_income: [0, 0]  # Should be [390, 390] or similar
    
    # This leads to overpayment
    ssi: [8_490, 8_490]  # Should be less due to countable income
