# Unit tests for SSI variable (final benefit calculation)
# These tests only use the direct inputs to the ssi variable

# Note: The 'abolish_ssi' parameter test would need a reform, which is not
# supported in the current test framework for YAML tests. This would need to be
# tested with a Python test instead.
