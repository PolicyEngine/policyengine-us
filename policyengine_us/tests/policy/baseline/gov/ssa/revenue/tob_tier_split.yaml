# Test that TOB revenue split matches Trustees Report projections
# Per 2025 Trustees Report (via CBPP):
#   - OASDI (tier 1): ~59% of total TOB revenue ($60.8B / $103.4B)
#   - Medicare HI (tier 2): ~41% of total TOB revenue ($42.6B / $103.4B)
#
# The statutory allocation is:
#   - Tier 1 (first 50% of benefits taxable): Revenue to OASDI
#   - Tier 2 (additional 35%, up to 85% taxable): Revenue to Medicare HI
#
# For a single retiree with $30K SS and $50K wages:
#   - Combined income = $50K + $15K (half SS) = $65K
#   - Above adjusted base ($34K), so 85% of SS taxable = $25,500
#   - Tier 1 should be ~59% of taxable ($15,045)
#   - Tier 2 should be ~41% of taxable ($10,455)
#
# BUG: Current implementation has tier_2 with only `subtracts` and no `adds`,
# which computes: 0 - total - tier1 = NEGATIVE (wrong!)
# Should be: adds=["tax_unit_taxable_social_security"], subtracts=["tier_1"]
