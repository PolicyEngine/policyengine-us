    # Tier 2 = 21_000 (from tier 2 test with adjusted employment_income)
    # Combined income = 60_000 + 15_000 = 75_000
    # Tier 1 = 4_500, Tier 2 = 21_000
    # Total taxable SS = 25_500
    # AGI = 60_000 + 25_500 = 85_500
    # Standard deduction = 14_600
    # Taxable income = 70_900
    # This will have positive income tax and thus positive TOB revenue
