  #Final PTC:
#    - KFF’s result:  $15,542 – $4,215 = $11,327 subsidy (annual).
#      => They say user’s share is $4,215 (or 5.62% of $75k).
#    - Ours might be: $15,550.90 – ($75,000 × 0.0560) = ~$11,350.90,
#      i.e. $4,200 difference from unsubsidized. The $14 difference
#      is a bit more than $1/month.
