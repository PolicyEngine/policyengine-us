# Test runner in policyengine-core uses `numexpr.evaluate()` under the hood
# to convert strings to expressions, where possible. This causes errors for
# FIPS codes with leading zeros, EVEN WHEN DEFINED AS STRINGS. However, they do
# work correctly in the code itself, as demonstrated with vectorized input 
# in last test case.
