description: Multiplier applied to all substitution elasticities for individuals at or above the age threshold. Research shows older workers have higher labor supply elasticities than working-age adults. French (2005) finds elasticities 3x higher for age 60 vs age 40. A multiplier of 2.0 is conservative. Set to 1.0 for no age difference.
