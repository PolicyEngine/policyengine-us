  description: Percent change (of the change in disposable income) in labor supply given a 1% change in disposable income. This parameter overrides the base income elasticity and age multiplier if provided.

    label: income elasticity of labor supply
base:
  description: Base income elasticity of labor supply for working-age individuals (under 65). This value is multiplied by the age multiplier for individuals 65 and over. Typically negative, indicating that higher income reduces labor supply.

age_threshold:
  description: Age at which the age multiplier begins to apply. Individuals at this age or older will have their base elasticity multiplied by the age multiplier. Default is 65 (typical retirement age), but can be adjusted to reflect different retirement patterns or policy scenarios (e.g., 62 for early retirement, 67 for full retirement age).

age_multiplier_over_threshold:
  description: Multiplier applied to base income elasticity for individuals at or above the age threshold. Research suggests income effects are stronger for older workers. French (2005) shows much higher elasticities near retirement age. A multiplier of 2.0 is conservative. Set to 1.0 for no age difference.
