base:
  description: Base income elasticity of labor supply for working-age individuals (under 65). This value is multiplied by the age multiplier for individuals 65 and over. Typically negative, indicating that higher income reduces labor supply.

age_multiplier_65_and_over:
  description: Multiplier applied to base income elasticity for individuals aged 65 and over. Research suggests income effects are stronger for older workers. French (2005) shows much higher elasticities near retirement age. A multiplier of 2.0 is conservative. Set to 1.0 for no age difference.
