description: Tennessee deducts up to this amount per child for dependent care expenses from countable income under the Families First TANF program, based on child age. These amounts apply for parents who choose to receive a deduction rather than having child care paid directly to the provider. The 2008 Administrative Code specified the same amounts ($200 under age 2, $175 age 2+) which are confirmed in the 2024 State Plan.
