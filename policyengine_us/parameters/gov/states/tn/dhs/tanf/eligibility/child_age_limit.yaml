description: Tennessee Families First TANF program requires dependent children to be under this age limit to qualify for assistance. Children who are 18 years old may still be eligible if they are full-time high school students expected to graduate before turning 19. The age 18 limit matches federal TANF requirements and has been consistent from 2008 through 2024.
