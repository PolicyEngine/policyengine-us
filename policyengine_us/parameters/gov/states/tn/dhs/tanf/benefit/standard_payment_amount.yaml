description: Tennessee provides up to this Standard Payment Amount (SPA) under the Families First TANF program based on assistance group size. The SPA is the maximum benefit payable to families not qualifying for the Differential Grant Payment Amount. Note - Complete 2024 tables for all family sizes were not found in publicly accessible sources. Values use 2008 amounts (most recent verifiable source) with 2024 update for family size 3 only (verified via NCCP 2024). The 2008 SPA represented 17.3% of CNS for family of 3; the 2024 SPA represents approximately 25% of CNS for family of 3 due to 2021 TANF Opportunity Act benefit increase.
