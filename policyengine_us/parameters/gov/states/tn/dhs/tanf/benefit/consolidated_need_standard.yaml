description: Tennessee establishes this Consolidated Need Standard (CNS) for the Families First TANF program, which represents the state's determination of the amount of income necessary to meet the basic needs of an assistance group of a given size. The CNS is used both as an income eligibility threshold and in the fill-the-gap benefit calculation. Note - The CNS is calculated annually by a contract agency per the 2024 State Plan. Complete 2024 tables for all family sizes were not found in publicly accessible sources. Values use 2008 amounts (most recent verifiable source) with 2024 update for family size 3 only (verified via NCCP 2024).
