description: Tennessee provides the higher Differential Grant Payment Amount (DGPA) instead of the Standard Payment Amount (SPA) when the caretaker relative is at or above this age threshold, is disabled, provides care for a disabled family member, or when no eligible adults are present in the assistance unit. The 2008 Administrative Code specified age 60 as the threshold.
