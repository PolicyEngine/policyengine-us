    rate:
      # The first bracket has a 0% rate, but when entering the second bracket,
      # a flat amount is added ($360.69 in 2024) plus the marginal rate on excess income.
      # This rate represents the implied average rate that would generate that flat amount
      # at the second bracket's threshold.
      #this creates a tax cliff
