# NOTE: NBER's historical state tax forms archive has directory structure
# suggesting forms from 1990-2008 and 2020-2025, but only 3 forms
# actually exist on their server (2020-2022). NH DRA forms are available
# from 2017-2023. For forms prior to 2017, NH DRA requires direct contact
# (Forms@dra.nh.gov or 603-230-5001). RSA 77 amendments from 1977 (561:1)
# and 1981 mention rate changes but specific historical rates are not
# documented in current statutes. Following TAXSIM's implementation for
# pre-2017 values in the absence of other sources.
