description: Washington sets these gross earned income limits for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.
# Note: These values follow the formula: Income Limit = (Payment Standard × 2) + $500
# This represents the break-even point where countable income equals the payment standard,
# resulting in $0 benefit. While mathematically derived, WAC 388-478-0035 publishes these
# as a table rather than a formula, so we preserve the table structure here.
