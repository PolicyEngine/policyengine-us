  Connecticut TFA income eligibility limits expressed as percentages of Federal
  Poverty Level (FPL).

  Connecticut uses a tiered income eligibility system that varies by enrollment
  status, allowing working families to retain TFA benefits as their earnings
  increase. This graduated approach helps families transition to self-sufficiency
  without sudden benefit loss.

  Income Eligibility Tiers:
  1. Initial/Standard of Need (55% FPL): New applicants must have earned income
     below this threshold to qualify for TFA.

  2. Continuing Eligibility (100% FPL): Once enrolled, households can earn up
     to this level with full earned income disregard, retaining maximum benefits.

  3. Extension Period (230% FPL): Effective January 1, 2024, families exceeding
     100% FPL can continue receiving TFA for up to 6 months if earnings remain
     under this threshold.

  Example (Family of 3, 2024 FPL = $2,152/month):
  - Initial limit (55% FPL): $1,184/month
  - Continuing limit (100% FPL): $2,152/month
  - Extension limit (230% FPL): $4,950/month

# Standard of need and initial eligibility
initial:
  description: >
    Initial eligibility requires gross earned income below this percentage of
    Federal Poverty Level for household size (55% FPL).

    This is Connecticut's "Standard of Need" - the income threshold new applicants
    must meet to qualify for TFA. This ensures TFA serves families with the lowest
    incomes who need cash assistance most urgently.

    Example (Family of 3, 2024):
    - Annual FPL: $25,820
    - Monthly FPL: $2,152
    - Initial limit (55%): $1,184/month
    - Family earning $1,200/month: Ineligible (over 55% FPL)
    - Family earning $1,000/month: Eligible (under 55% FPL)

# Continuing eligibility
continuing:
  description: >
    Active TFA households can earn up to this percentage of Federal Poverty Level
    and remain eligible, with full earned income disregard (100% FPL).

    This generous policy allows enrolled families to work and increase earnings
    without losing TFA benefits, as all earnings up to 100% FPL are disregarded
    when calculating countable income. This work incentive helps families become
    financially stable while maintaining a safety net.

    Example (Family of 3, 2024):
    - Monthly FPL: $2,152
    - Continuing limit (100%): $2,152/month
    - Family earns $1,800/month: Fully disregarded, receives full TFA benefit
    - Family earns $2,100/month: Fully disregarded, receives full TFA benefit
    - Family earns $2,500/month: Enters extension period (over 100% FPL)

# Extension period eligibility (effective January 1, 2024)
extension:
  description: >
    After earnings exceed 100 percent FPL, families may continue receiving benefits
    for up to 6 consecutive months with earnings disregarded up to this percentage
    of Federal Poverty Level for eligibility purposes (230% FPL).

    This extension period policy (effective January 1, 2024) provides a gradual
    transition from TFA to full employment. Families in the extension period with
    earnings between 171% and 230% FPL receive benefits reduced by 20%, helping
    them adjust to higher income while maintaining partial support.

    Extension Period Rules:
    - Duration: Up to 6 consecutive months
    - Earnings 100%-171% FPL: Full benefit (minus countable income over 100% FPL)
    - Earnings 171%-230% FPL: Benefit reduced by 20%
    - Earnings over 230% FPL: Ineligible

    Example (Family of 3, 2024):
    - Monthly FPL: $2,152
    - Extension limit (230%): $4,950/month
    - Family earns $3,500/month (163% FPL): Eligible, no reduction
    - Family earns $4,000/month (186% FPL): Eligible, 20% reduction applies
    - Family earns $5,000/month (232% FPL): Ineligible
