  Connecticut TFA income disregards and deductions.

  Connecticut applies various income disregards to encourage work and support
  families while receiving TFA assistance. These disregards reduce the amount
  of income counted when determining benefit levels.

  Key Disregards:
  - $90 initial application deduction (per earner)
  - 100% student income disregard
  - $50/month child support passthrough

# Initial application deduction
initial_application_deduction:
  description: >
    Connecticut deducts this amount from each person's gross earnings at time of
    initial application for TFA ($90 per earner).

    This per-earner deduction applies only at initial application to determine if
    the household meets the 55% FPL income eligibility threshold. Once enrolled,
    the more generous continuing eligibility disregard (100% of earnings up to
    100% FPL) applies instead.

    Example (Family with 2 earners at initial application):
    - Earner 1 gross: $600/month
    - Earner 2 gross: $400/month
    - Total gross: $1,000/month
    - Initial deduction: $90 + $90 = $180
    - Countable income: $1,000 - $180 = $820/month

    Note: This parameter is maintained for historical completeness but the current
    implementation uses the continuing eligibility disregard (100% up to FPL) for
    simplicity, which is more generous and reflects typical household experience.

# Student income disregard
student_income_disregard:
  description: >
    Connecticut fully disregards earned income of a child who is a student in
    determining eligibility, standard of need, and amount of assistance
    (100% disregard per Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง 17b-80).

    This policy encourages education by ensuring that a student child's part-time
    work earnings don't reduce the family's TFA benefits. The disregard applies to
    children who are students in high school, vocational school, or higher education.

    Example:
    - Family of 3 includes high school student earning $500/month part-time
    - Student income fully excluded from gross income calculation
    - Only parent/guardian earnings count toward TFA income limits

# Child support passthrough
child_support_passthrough:
  description: >
    Connecticut passes through this amount of child support to the household and
    excludes it from benefit calculation ($50/month).

    The child support passthrough ensures that child support payments benefit the
    child rather than simply offset TFA benefits. The first $50/month of child
    support received is passed through to the family and excluded from countable
    income. Any child support over $50/month is counted as unearned income.

    Example 1 (Child support $75/month):
    - Child support received: $75
    - Passthrough exclusion: $50 (first $50)
    - Countable unearned income: $75 - $50 = $25

    Example 2 (Child support $30/month):
    - Child support received: $30
    - Passthrough exclusion: $30 (all of it, under $50)
    - Countable unearned income: $0

    This policy encourages non-custodial parents to pay child support by ensuring
    the payment increases the custodial family's total resources.
