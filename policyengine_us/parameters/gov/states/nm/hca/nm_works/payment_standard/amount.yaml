# Budgetary Adjustment History:
# Due to state budget constraints, NM implemented a 15% budgetary adjustment on 2011-01-01,
# reducing the maximum monthly benefit below the payment standard. In August 2015, this was
# reduced to 7.5%. The adjustment was fully removed on 2018-11-01. The values below reflect
# the effective payment standard (after any budgetary adjustment) for each period.
#
# 2015-08-01: 7.5% budgetary adjustment applied (e.g., size 3: $447 - $38 = $409)
# 2018-11-01: Budgetary adjustment removed (e.g., size 3: $447)
# 2023-08-01: 23% increase to payment standards (e.g., size 3: $549)
