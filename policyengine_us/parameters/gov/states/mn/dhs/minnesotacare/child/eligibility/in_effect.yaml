  Whether MinnesotaCare coverage for undocumented children is in effect.
  The 2023 Minnesota Legislature expanded MinnesotaCare to include undocumented
  individuals, with coverage beginning January 1, 2025. While coverage for
  undocumented adults was later restricted effective June 15, 2025, children
  under 19 continue to be eligible. Coverage is state-only funded and delivered
  on a fee-for-service basis.
