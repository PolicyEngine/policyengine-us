description: Missouri TANF maximum benefit is calculated as 34.526% of the Standard of Need. This percentage is used in the final Percentage of Need test (the third income eligibility test) and determines the maximum benefit amount. If countable income after all disregards is less than this percentage of the Standard of Need, the family is eligible and the benefit equals (34.526% × Standard of Need) - Net Countable Income. Frozen since 1991.
