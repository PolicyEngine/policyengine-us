  reference:
  # If your Virginia AGI (VAGI) minus an age deduction (specified in Section 58.1-322.03 Subdivision 5) < amount, you don't have to file.
  # By statute, VAGI is defined to not include the age deduction. See https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-321/, Subdivision 2, Paragraph 2.
  # However, in the tax instructions, VAGI is implicitly defined to include the age deduction. The following language is from the 2024 instructions: "Complete Form 760, Lines 1 through 9, to determine your Virginia adjusted gross income (VAGI)." Note that in 2024's Form 760, the age deduction is computed and subtracted from federal AGI in lines 4 and 9 respectively.
