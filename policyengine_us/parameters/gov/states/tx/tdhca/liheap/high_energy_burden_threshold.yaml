  Texas defines high energy burden as households spending 10% or more of their income
  on home energy costs. This threshold identifies households where utility expenses
  create financial hardship, qualifying them for priority group status and a 20%
  benefit increase. The national average energy burden is approximately 3%, while
  low-income households typically face 8-10% burden.
  
  Examples of high energy burden:
  - $1,500/month income with $180/month utilities = 12% burden (HIGH)
  - $2,500/month income with $200/month utilities = 8% burden (NOT HIGH)
  - $1,000/month income with $120/month utilities = 12% burden (HIGH)
  
  High energy burden often results from:
  - Inefficient housing with poor insulation
  - Old, inefficient heating/cooling systems
  - Extreme weather requiring more energy use
  - Fixed incomes not keeping pace with energy costs
  
  Research shows households with >10% energy burden face difficult tradeoffs
  between heating/cooling and other necessities like food and medicine.
