  Texas provides a 20% benefit increase (1.2 multiplier) to households in priority groups,
  ensuring vulnerable populations receive additional assistance. Priority households include
  those with elderly members (60+), disabled members, young children (under 6), or high
  energy burden (>10% of income). This multiplier is applied to the base benefit amount
  before maximum limits are enforced.
  
  Example calculations:
  - Non-priority single person: $6,396 base × 1.0 = $6,396 final
  - Priority elderly person: $6,396 base × 1.2 = $7,675 final
  - Priority family of 4: $12,300 base × 1.2 = $14,760 (capped at $12,300 max)
  
  The 20% increase recognizes that priority households often face:
  - Higher energy needs due to medical equipment
  - Greater health risks from extreme temperatures
  - Fixed incomes that can't adjust to rising energy costs
  - Higher usage due to being home more often
