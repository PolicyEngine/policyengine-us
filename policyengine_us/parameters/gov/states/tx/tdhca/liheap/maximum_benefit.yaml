  Texas limits regular LIHEAP assistance to this maximum amount per household per year.
  This cap ensures equitable distribution of limited federal funds while providing
  meaningful assistance to eligible households. The maximum applies after all adjustments
  including household size factors and priority group multipliers.
  
  Examples of how maximum is applied:
  - Small household: May receive less than maximum based on size adjustment
  - Large priority household: Base benefit may exceed maximum but is capped at $12,300
  - Crisis assistance: Has separate $1,400 maximum, not counted against this limit
  
  The $12,300 maximum represents approximately:
  - 6-8 months of average utility bills for a low-income household
  - Full year coverage for energy-efficient homes
  - Substantial assistance toward high summer cooling or winter heating costs
