  Texas designates households with children under age 6 as priority groups for LIHEAP
  assistance. Young children are particularly vulnerable to temperature extremes and
  their developing bodies are more susceptible to health impacts from inadequate
  heating or cooling. Priority status provides a 20% benefit increase.
  
  Rationale for under-6 threshold:
  - Critical developmental period requiring stable temperatures
  - Higher risk of heat-related illness and hypothermia
  - Inability to self-regulate or communicate discomfort effectively
  - Aligns with Head Start and early childhood program definitions
  
  Examples of young child priority households:
  - Family with 2-year-old: Qualifies for priority status
  - Single parent with 5-year-old: Qualifies (child still under 6)
  - Household with newborn: Qualifies for priority status
  - Family with 6-year-old: Does not qualify (child has reached age 6)
  - Pregnant woman: Does not qualify until child is born
  
  Note: Age is determined at the start of the benefit year. A child who turns 6
  during the year maintains priority status for that full year.
