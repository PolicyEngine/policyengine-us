  Texas designates households with members aged 60 or older as priority groups for
  LIHEAP assistance. Elderly individuals face increased health risks from extreme
  temperatures and often live on fixed incomes that cannot adjust to rising energy
  costs. Priority status provides a 20% benefit increase and ensures service during
  funding shortages.
  
  Rationale for 60+ threshold:
  - Aligns with federal Older Americans Act definition
  - Recognizes increased vulnerability to temperature extremes
  - Accounts for higher medical equipment energy needs
  - Addresses fixed income constraints of retirees
  
  Examples of elderly priority households:
  - 65-year-old living alone: Qualifies for priority status
  - Couple ages 58 and 61: Qualifies (one member is 60+)
  - Multi-generational home with 70-year-old grandparent: Qualifies
  - 59-year-old disabled veteran: Does not qualify for elderly priority
    (but may qualify for disability priority)
