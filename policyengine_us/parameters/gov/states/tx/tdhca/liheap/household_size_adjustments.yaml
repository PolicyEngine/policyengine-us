  Texas uses these adjustment factors to scale LIHEAP benefits based on household size,
  recognizing economies of scale in home energy costs. The factors multiply the maximum
  benefit amount to determine each household's base benefit. A 4-person household serves
  as the baseline (1.00 factor), with smaller households receiving proportionally less
  and larger households receiving more. These adjustments ensure equitable distribution
  while acknowledging that energy costs don't increase linearly with household size.
  
  Example calculations:
  - 1-person household: $12,300 × 0.52 = $6,396 base benefit
  - 4-person household: $12,300 × 1.00 = $12,300 base benefit  
  - 8-person household: $12,300 × 1.64 = $20,172 base benefit (capped at maximum)
  
  The factors increase by approximately 16% for each additional household member,
  reflecting the incremental energy usage of additional occupants.
