description: >
  Texas guarantees this minimum amount of LIHEAP assistance to all eligible households,
  ensuring that every qualifying household receives some level of energy assistance
  regardless of calculation results. While largely symbolic at $1, this minimum ensures
  that administrative errors or unusual calculations don't result in zero benefits for
  eligible households. In practice, the base benefit calculation typically results in
  amounts well above this minimum.
  
  The minimum benefit serves to:
  - Guarantee assistance to all eligible households
  - Prevent calculation errors from denying benefits
  - Establish household's participation in the program
  - Enable tracking of all assisted households
  
  Note: Even the smallest household (1 person) typically receives $6,396 base benefit
  (52% of $12,300 maximum), so this $1 minimum rarely applies in practice.
