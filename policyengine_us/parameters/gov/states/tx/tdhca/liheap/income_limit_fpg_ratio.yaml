  Texas uses 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines as the income eligibility threshold
  for LIHEAP assistance. This is the maximum ratio allowed under federal regulations.
  States may choose lower thresholds but cannot exceed 150% of FPG or 60% of state
  median income, whichever is greater.
  
  Income limit examples for 2024:
  - 1-person household: $15,060 × 1.5 = $22,590 annual limit
  - 2-person household: $20,440 × 1.5 = $30,660 annual limit
  - 3-person household: $25,820 × 1.5 = $38,730 annual limit
  - 4-person household: $31,200 × 1.5 = $46,800 annual limit
  
  This threshold captures working poor families who struggle with energy costs
  despite having employment income. At 150% FPG, a family of four can earn up to
  $46,800 annually (about $22.50/hour for one full-time worker) and still qualify.
