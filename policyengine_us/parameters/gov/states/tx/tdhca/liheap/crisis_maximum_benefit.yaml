  Texas limits crisis LIHEAP assistance to this maximum amount per household per year
  for emergency energy situations. Crisis assistance addresses immediate threats to
  health and safety such as utility disconnections, empty fuel tanks, or broken
  heating/cooling equipment. This is separate from and in addition to regular LIHEAP
  benefits.
  
  Crisis situations that qualify for assistance:
  - Utility disconnection notice (within 72 hours)
  - Already disconnected service requiring reconnection
  - Propane/heating oil tank near empty (<10% capacity)
  - Broken furnace or air conditioner creating health hazard
  - Past due utility bills threatening service
  
  Example crisis payments:
  - $850 electric bill to prevent disconnection (paid in full)
  - $2,800 past due balance (pays $2,400 maximum, household pays $400)
  - $1,500 furnace repair in winter (paid in full)
  - $600 propane tank refill (paid in full)
  
  Crisis funds are paid directly to the utility company or service provider,
  not to the household, ensuring the emergency is resolved.
