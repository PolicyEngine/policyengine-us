description: Texas uses this share as the additional child copayment factor under the Child Care Services program.

# The BCY2025 chart says "Add 0.15% for each additional child", which is
# the rate increment per 10% SMI bracket step (e.g., 0.30% at 20%, 0.45% at 30%).
# The BCY2026 chart shows the rate at each bracket explicitly (0.015% at 1% SMI).
# Both describe the same linear formula: rate = SMI% * 1.5%, so the factor is 0.015.
# At higher SMI brackets, the 7% total cap reduces the effective rate.
