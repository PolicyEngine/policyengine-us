# The BCY2025 chart shows 9 brackets starting at 5% SMI (2.27%, 3.27%, ..., 7.00%).
# The BCY2026 chart shows 9 brackets starting at 1% SMI (2.00%, 2.93%, ..., 7.00%).
# Both represent the same linear formula: rate = base + slope * (SMI% - min_SMI%).
# Only the first (1%) and last uncapped (75%) brackets are stored here;
# the formula derives slope = (0.0693 - 0.02) / (0.75 - 0.01) at runtime.
# The 85% bracket (7.00%) is the cap, handled separately by maximum.yaml.
