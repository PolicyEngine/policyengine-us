  reference:
  # "The credit is reduced by twenty dollars ($20) for each one hundred dollars ($100), or fraction thereof, 
  # by which the qualified taxpayer’s earned income, as defined in Section 17052, exceeds the "threshold amount."
  # For Tax Years Starting January 1, 2024 (Clause (ii)(III)):
  # The Franchise Tax Board calculates a graduated reduction amount that ensures the credit phases out to $0 
  # exactly when the taxpayer’s income exceeds the maximum limit for eligibility.
