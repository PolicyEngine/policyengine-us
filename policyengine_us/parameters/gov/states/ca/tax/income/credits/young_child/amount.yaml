  # The legal code specifies the amount as $1,176 multiplied by the CalEITC adjustment factor ($1,000 in 2021).
  # Since the base value is adjusted annually with inflation.
  # For accuracy, we use the final product as the parameter value 
  # due to the tax forms showing inflation-adjusted final values and not the base value.
