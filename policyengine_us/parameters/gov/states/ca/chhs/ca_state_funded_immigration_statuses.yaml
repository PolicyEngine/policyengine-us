description: California includes these immigration statuses as eligible for state-funded coverage under the Medi-Cal program.

# TODO: After Oct 2026, federal OBBBA removes refugees, asylees, parolees,
# PRUCOL, and others from federal Medicaid funding. Whether CA will cover
# these groups with state funds is uncertain as of Jan 2026:
# - Current state law: keep full-scope Medi-Cal with dental
# - DHCS interpretation: move to Medi-Cal with no dental + premiums
# - Governor's proposed budget (Jan 9, 2026): restricted-scope only
# Update this parameter when legislation clarifies the outcome.
