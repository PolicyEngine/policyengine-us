  # TODO: After Oct 2026, federal OBBBA removes refugees, asylees, parolees,
  # PRUCOL, and others from federal Medicaid funding. Whether CA will cover
  # these groups with state funds is uncertain as of Jan 2026:
  # - Current state law: keep full-scope Medi-Cal with dental
  # - DHCS interpretation: move to Medi-Cal with no dental + premiums
  # - Governor's proposed budget (Jan 9, 2026): restricted-scope only
  # Update this parameter when legislation clarifies the outcome.
