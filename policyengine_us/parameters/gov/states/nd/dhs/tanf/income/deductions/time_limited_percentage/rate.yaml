description: North Dakota excludes this share of earned income as a time limited percentage disregard under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.
# NOTE: This uses calendar month as a proxy for participation months.
# The disregard cycle resets each January (month 1).
# In reality, TLP tracks cumulative participation months, but PolicyEngine
# currently lacks the infrastructure to track state over time.
