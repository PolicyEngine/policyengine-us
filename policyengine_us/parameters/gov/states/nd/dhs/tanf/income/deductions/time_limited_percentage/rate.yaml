description: North Dakota excludes this share of earned income as a time limited percentage disregard under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.
# NOTE: TLP is actually a declining 12-month disregard cycle:
#   - Months 1-6: 50%
#   - Months 7-9: 35%
#   - Months 10-12: 25%
#   - Month 13+: 0%
# PolicyEngine cannot track months on TANF across periods, so we use 50%
# (the rate for months 1-6) as a simplification.
