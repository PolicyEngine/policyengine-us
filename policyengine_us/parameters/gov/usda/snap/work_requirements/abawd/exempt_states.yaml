# P.L. 119-21 gives HI and AK preferential waiver authority
# (150% unemployment threshold, good-faith exemptions through 2028-12-31)
# per 7 U.S.C. 2015(o)(4)(A)(ii) and 2015(o)(7). However, both states
# chose to implement ABAWD effective 2025-11-01. AK also has borough-level
# waivers for high-unemployment areas. This parameter is not consumed by
# any formula; HI/AK delayed adoption is handled in a follow-up PR via
# state-level hr1_in_effect parameters.
