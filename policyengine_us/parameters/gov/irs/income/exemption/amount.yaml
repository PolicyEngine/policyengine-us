description: >-
  Personal and dependent exemption amount under IRC 151(d). TCJA set the
  deduction to $0 from 2018 (made permanent by OBBB), but the underlying
  amount continues to be inflation-adjusted and published in annual Rev. Proc.
  for other provisions that reference it, such as the qualifying relative
  gross income test under IRC 152(d)(1)(B). The deduction suspension is
  represented separately in gov.irs.income.exemption.suspended.
