  label: Minimum birth year for Baby Bonus eligibility
  reference: placeholder - bill not yet introduced
  notes:
    - The bill allows payment for children born in this year and after, and does not
      specifically limit payment to the birth year (could technically be claimed after).
      However, for our modeling purposes, we simplify by paying out during the birth year only.
    - The bill also allows payment during pregnancy (e.g., a payment could be sent in late 2026
      for a child expected to be born in early 2027). For simplicity, we model the payment
      as occurring when the child is born, in their birth year.
