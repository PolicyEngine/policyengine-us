      note: >
        This reform extends the statutory framework with a simplified
        linear progression starting at 100% FPL
  note: >
    Linear progression formula: For income above 100% FPL, the contribution
    percentage increases by 4 percentage points per 100% FPL increment.

    Examples:
    - 100% FPL: 0%
    - 200% FPL: 0% + (1 × 4%) = 4%
    - 300% FPL: 0% + (2 × 4%) = 8%
    - 400% FPL: 0% + (3 × 4%) = 12%
    - 600% FPL: 0% + (5 × 4%) = 20%

    This creates a simpler, more aggressive phase-out compared to the
    additional bracket reform, reaching higher contribution percentages
    at the same income levels.
