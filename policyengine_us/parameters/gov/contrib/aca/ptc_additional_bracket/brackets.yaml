  Custom ACA PTC contribution percentages by household income (MAGI as
  fraction of FPL). This is a hypothetical reform structure that extends
  beyond current law to create a more gradual phase-out of premium tax
  credits at higher income levels.

      note: >
        Uses 2021 baseline contribution percentage values (0%, 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%)
        for income levels up to 300% FPL as the foundation
  note: >
    Linear progression formula: For income above 300% FPL, the contribution
    percentage increases by 4 percentage points per 100% FPL increment.

    Examples:
    - 400% FPL: 6% + (1 × 4%) = 10%
    - 600% FPL: 6% + (3 × 4%) = 18%
    - 1000% FPL: 6% + (7 × 4%) = 34%

    This creates a smooth transition that gradually reduces subsidies as
    income increases, rather than having a sharp cliff at 400% FPL as in
    the original ACA structure.
