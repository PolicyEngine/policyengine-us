  note: >
    This parameter controls a hypothetical structural reform to the ACA
    premium tax credit system. When set to true, it activates the extended
    bracket structure defined in the associated brackets.yaml file, which
    continues premium subsidies beyond the current 400% FPL cliff with a
    gradual phase-out pattern.
