### Background on Economic Uprating variables related to income, taxation, and social security benefits

The system models 17 distinct income categories, each uprated according to its economic fundamentals:

*Primary Categories with Specific Projections:*
- Employment income (wages) - follows CBO wage growth projections
- Self-employment income - follows CBO business income projections
- Capital gains - follows CBO asset appreciation projections
- Interest income - follows CBO interest rate projections
- Dividend income - follows CBO corporate profit projections
- Pension income - follows CBO retirement income projections
- Social Security - follows SSA COLA projections (available through 2100)

*Secondary Categories with Derived Projections:*
- Business income (partnerships, S-corps) - follows self-employment patterns
- Farm income - follows agricultural economic indices
- Retirement distributions (401k, IRA) - follows pension uprating
- Unemployment compensation - follows labor market projections

*Minor Categories with AGI-Based Uprating:*
- Miscellaneous income, debt relief, and other small categories follow total Adjusted Gross Income growth as a reasonable proxy

This tiered approach maintains realistic income composition evolution while remaining computationally tractable. Behavioral responses including labor supply and capital gains realization elasticities further refine projections.
