def tax_employer_social_security_tax_reform() -> Reform:
    """
    General workflow for creating reform:
    1. Make a boolean for the reform under parameters/contrib/{reform name}
    called in_effect.
    2. Create new variables if necessary.
    3. Redefine rule for calculating existing variable (in this case social
    security taxation).
    3a. Add an init file to initialize the create_{reform name}_reform function.
    4. Add this reform to reforms/reforms.py (see previous pull requests for
    syntax).
    5. Add a unit test under tests/contrib/{reform name}
    if the reform is not just modifying a parameter
    5a. Add unit test for new variables under
    tests/baseline/{new variable's path}

    Specific to this reform:
    We want to modify how an existing variable is calculated.
    In this case it's "irs_gross_income", as in:
    "policyengine_us/variables/gov/irs/income/taxable_income/
    adjusted_gross_income/irs_gross_income/irs_gross_income.py"
    We amend irs_gross_income because the employer-side contributions
    will go into taxable income...
    but taxable income is determined at the tax unit level,
    by summing up all persons' gross income
    and deducting tax unit's deductions. But since payroll is calculated at
    the personal level,
    we want to add each person's employer contribution to each person, thus
    we add it to gross income.

    irs_gross_income refers to "parameters/gov/irs/gross_income/sources"
    to determine which sources of income get added into the variable.
    We modify that list by adding the two variables we created for this
    reform: they are employer's payroll taxes for
    (i) social security and (ii) medicare.
    The new variabes are under "variables/gov/irs/tax/payroll
    /social_security/employer_social_security_tax.py"
    and "policyengine_us/variables/gov/irs/tax/payroll/medicare/
    employer_medicare_tax.py"
