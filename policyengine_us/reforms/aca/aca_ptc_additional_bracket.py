        ACA Premium Tax Credit phase-out rate with additional bracket structure.

        This reform implements an extended bracket structure that continues
        premium subsidies beyond the standard 400% FPL cliff. It uses 2021
        baseline values up to 300% FPL, then increases contribution percentages
        linearly at 4 percentage points per 100% FPL.

        The reform creates a more gradual phase-out of subsidies, reducing the
        cliff effect where households just above 400% FPL lose all subsidies.
