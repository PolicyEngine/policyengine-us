        ACA Premium Tax Credit phase-out rate with linear bracket extension.

        This reform extends premium subsidies beyond the standard 400% FPL cliff
        using a linear formula. Above the transition threshold (typically 300% FPL),
        the contribution percentage increases linearly based on the increment rate
        (typically 4 percentage points per 100% FPL).

        The reform creates a more gradual phase-out of subsidies, reducing the
        cliff effect where households just above 400% FPL lose all subsidies.
