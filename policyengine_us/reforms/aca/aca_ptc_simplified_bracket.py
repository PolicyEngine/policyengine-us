        ACA Premium Tax Credit phase-out rate with simplified linear progression.

        This reform creates a single linear phase-out starting at 100% FPL,
        where the contribution percentage increases by 4 percentage points
        per 100% FPL increment. This results in a simpler, more aggressive
        phase-out compared to the additional bracket reform.

        The reform eliminates the standard ACA bracket structure entirely,
        replacing it with one continuous linear progression from 100% FPL
        onwards.
