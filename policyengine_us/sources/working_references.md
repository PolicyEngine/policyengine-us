- **Vehicle exemption**: $5,000 equity value in one automobile

- **Recipients with child under age 6** (working minimum 20 hours): $240 flat deduction
- **Additional Disregard**: 50% of remaining earned income after work expense deduction

**Formula**:
```
For applicants:
Countable Earned Income = (Gross Earned Income - $120) x 0.50

For recipients with child under 6:
Countable Earned Income = (Gross Earned Income - $240) x 0.50
```

**Citation**: OAC 340:10-3-31.1 and OAC 340:10-3-33
**Source**: https://oklahoma.gov/okdhs/library/policy/current/oac-340/chapter-10/subchapter-3/parts-3/earned-income-disregard.html

#### Earned Income Disregard Period (OAC 340:10-3-31.1)
- Maximum combined monthly earned income during EID period: $2,064
- When recipient remains eligible after applying exemptions, they are NOT eligible for the EID period
- **Note**: This is a time-limited benefit that cannot be fully simulated

#### Dependent Care Deduction
- Actual child and adult dependent care expenses paid by the individual
- Must not be paid through other state/federal funds
- Dependent care must be in a licensed facility or home

### Unearned Income (OAC 340:10-3-39)
- Counted at gross amount
- No standard deductions for unearned income

#### Income Disregards (OAC 340:10-3-40)
The following income types are disregarded:
1. SNAP/Food benefit allotment
2. SSI income of any adult or child in the household
3. Educational assistance (grants, scholarships, work-study, loans with deferred payment, veterans education benefits)
4. Workforce training program payments (WIOA)
5. Financial aid from agencies when purpose doesn't duplicate TANF
6. Oklahoma DRS income for items not covered by TANF
7. Earnings of a child who is a full-time student

### Benefit Calculation

#### Formula
```
Benefit = Payment Standard - Countable Income
```

Where:
- **Payment Standard**: From Schedule IX based on family size
- **Countable Income**: Net earned income + gross unearned income

#### Example (from OAC 340:10-3-31.1):
- Family size: 3 persons
- Payment standard: $292
- Gross earnings: $700/month
- Work expense deduction: $240
- 50% of remainder: ($700 - $240) x 0.50 = $230
- Countable earned income: $700 - $240 - $230 = $230
- Benefit: $292 - $230 = $62

#### Minimum Benefit
- **Amount**: $10
- If calculated benefit is less than $10, no payment issues (but case remains open)
- **Citation**: OAC 340:10-3-59

#### Maximum Benefit
- Cannot exceed the 9-person payment standard
- Adults and/or Children: $650/month
- Children Only: $720/month
- **Citation**: OAC 340:10-3-59

### Emergency Assistance (TANF-EA)

## Implementation Approach

### Use Federal Baseline For:
- [x] Immigration eligibility (follows federal rules with standard exemptions)
- [x] Standard TANF income sources

### Create State-Specific Variables For:
- [ ] `ok_tanf_income_eligible` - Uses 185% of State Standard of Need
- [ ] `ok_tanf_resources_eligible` - $1,000 limit
- [ ] `ok_tanf_countable_earned_income` - $120/$240 + 50% disregard
- [ ] `ok_tanf_countable_income` - Earned + unearned after disregards
- [ ] `ok_tanf_payment_standard` - By family size from Schedule IX
- [ ] `ok_tanf_maximum_benefit` - Based on payment standard
- [ ] `ok_tanf` - Final benefit calculation
- [ ] `ok_tanf_age_eligible_child` - Through 18 (19 if full-time student)
- [ ] `ok_tanf_eligible` - Combined eligibility check

## Notes and Clarifications

### Resource Limit Discrepancy
Some sources report $1,000, others $2,250 as the resource limit. The official OAC and OKDHS Live website indicate **$1,000** is the current countable reserve limit. The $2,250 figure may be from older documentation or a different context (possibly total including certain exclusions).

**Recommendation**: Use $1,000 as the resource limit per Schedule IX notation.

### Earned Income Disregard Complexity
The $120 vs $240 distinction depends on:
- Applicant status: $120
- Recipient status with child under age 6 and working 20+ hours: $240

**Recommendation**: For simplified implementation, may need to use a single work expense deduction or create a variable to determine applicant vs recipient status.

### Benefit Formula Clarification
The benefit calculation follows:
1. Apply work expense deduction ($120 or $240)
2. Apply 50% disregard to remaining earned income
3. Result is countable earned income
4. Add countable unearned income
5. Subtract total countable income from payment standard
6. Result is benefit (minimum $10, maximum per schedule)
