**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025
**Effective Date**: Current as of 2024

## Payment Formula

**Basic Formula** (Florida Statute § 414.095(12)):
```
Monthly TCA Benefit = Payment Standard - Net Countable Income
```

- Resulting figure rounded down to nearest dollar
- Minimum grant: $10
- Recipients receiving less than $10 don't receive cash but retain Medicaid and food assistance eligibility

## Payment Standards (Three-Tier System)

**Tier Structure** (Florida Statute § 414.095(10)):
- **Tier 1**: No shelter obligation
- **Tier 2**: Shelter obligation between $1 and $50
- **Tier 3**: Shelter obligation greater than $50 OR homeless

**Shelter obligations include**: mortgage payment, rent, room and board

## Income Calculation

### Income Definition (FAC Rule 65A-4.209)

**Income**: "Cash received at periodic intervals from any source including but not limited to wages, benefits, contributions, and rental property."

**Total Gross Monthly Income** includes:
- Earned income from all sources
- Unearned income from all sources
- Deemed income from:
  - Stepparent living in home with TCA child
  - Parent living in home with minor mother payee
  - Ineligible noncitizen's parents (during 5-year disqualification)
  - Sponsor and sponsor's spouse of certain noncitizens

### Income Exclusions

**Earned Income Exclusions**:
1. Full-time student minor child's earned income (elementary or secondary school or equivalent career training)
2. All income of minor child received under Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA)
3. Adult income from WIOA (except wages paid directly by employer)
4. Child's earned income if child is family member, attends high school or equivalent, and is 19 or younger

**Unearned Income Exclusions**:
- Infrequent or irregular unearned income not exceeding $60 per calendar quarter
- Examples: gifts for Christmas, birthdays, graduation
- First $50 of child support may be excluded

### Earned Income Disregards

**Two-Step Disregard** (Florida Statute § 414.095):

**Step 1 - Standard Disregard**: $90 per individual
- Each individual in the assistance group receives $90 deduction from gross earned income

**Step 2 - Work Incentive Disregard**: First $200 plus one-half of remainder
- Formula: Disregard = $200 + (Remaining Earned Income × 0.5)
- This provides incentive for employment

**Calculation Example**:
```
Gross Earned Income: $1,000
- Step 1: $1,000 - $90 = $910
- Step 2: $910 - $200 = $710
- Step 2 (cont.): $710 × 0.5 = $355 (half of remainder also disregarded)
- Countable Earned Income: $710 - $355 = $355
```

Alternative calculation method:
```
After $90 disregard: $910
After $200 disregard: $710
Countable earned income: $710 × 0.5 = $355
```

### Need Determination Process

**Eligibility Test** (FAC Rule 65A-4.209):
- "Total average gross monthly income less any applicable disregards"
- Cannot exceed "applicable payment standard for the assistance group"

**Comparison Formula**:
```
If (Gross Income - Disregards) ≤ Payment Standard → Eligible
```

## Family Cap Policy

**Additional Children Born While Receiving TANF**:

Florida is one of 6 states with a family cap policy that reduces or denies benefits for children born to TANF participants.

**Benefit Reduction**:
- **Second child**: Benefits reduced by 50%
  - Example: Second child receives ~$31/month instead of full $62 increment
- **Third and subsequent children**: NO financial assistance provided

**Exceptions**:
- Parent is incarcerated
- Parent is institutionalized
- Child resulted from rape, incest, or sexual exploitation

**Source**: Florida Policy Institute analysis and Administration for Children and Families TANF data

## Budgeting Methodology

**Budgeting Period** (FAC Rule 65A-4.210):
- Rule effective 3/13/2024
- Implements Florida Statute § 414.085, § 414.095(10)-(12), (14), § 414.14

**Note**: Complete budgeting methodology details require access to full rule text. General principles follow federal TANF guidance on prospective budgeting.

## Payment Schedule

**Distribution** (FAC Rule 65A-4.220):
- Benefits distributed monthly throughout eligibility period
- Recipients relocating out-of-state may receive one additional month upon request
- Temporary absences of 30 days or less don't affect residency status

## Sample Calculations

### Example 1: Single Parent, One Child, Tier 3 (Shelter >$50)
```
Family size: 2
Payment standard (Tier 3): $241
Gross earned income: $800/month
Unearned income: $0

Step 1: Apply $90 disregard
$800 - $90 = $710

Step 2: Apply work incentive disregard ($200 + half of remainder)
$710 - $200 = $510
$510 × 0.5 = $255 (amount disregarded)
Countable earned income: $510 - $255 = $255

Net countable income: $255

Benefit calculation:
$241 (payment standard) - $255 (net income) = -$14
Result: NOT ELIGIBLE (income exceeds payment standard)
```

### Example 2: Single Parent, Two Children, Tier 3 (Shelter >$50)
```
Family size: 3
Payment standard (Tier 3): $303
Gross earned income: $500/month
Unearned income: $0

Step 1: Apply $90 disregard
$500 - $90 = $410

Step 2: Apply work incentive disregard
$410 - $200 = $210
$210 × 0.5 = $105 (amount disregarded)
Countable earned income: $210 - $105 = $105

Net countable income: $105

Benefit calculation:
$303 - $105 = $198

Monthly TANF benefit: $198
```

### Example 3: No Earned Income, Tier 2 (Shelter $1-$50)
```
Family size: 3
Payment standard (Tier 2): $258
Gross earned income: $0
Unearned income (child support): $100/month

First $50 of child support excluded: $100 - $50 = $50
Net countable income: $50

Benefit calculation:
$258 - $50 = $208

Monthly TANF benefit: $208
```
