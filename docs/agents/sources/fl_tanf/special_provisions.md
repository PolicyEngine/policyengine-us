**Source**: Florida Statute Chapter 414 and Florida Administrative Code Chapter 65A-4
**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025
**Effective Date**: Current as of 2024

## State-Specific Policies

### 1. Family Cap Policy

Florida is one of only 6 states that deny parents some or all TANF benefits for additional children born while participating in TANF.

**Implementation** (Based on Florida Policy Institute analysis):

**Second Child Born While Receiving TANF**:
- Benefits reduced by 50% of normal increment
- Example: Baby receives $31/month instead of full $62 increment
- Calculated as half of the difference between 3-person and 2-person payment standards

**Third and Subsequent Children**:
- **NO cash assistance provided** for any additional children
- Complete denial of benefits for these children

**Exceptions**:
Only children born under the following circumstances receive benefits:
1. Parent is incarcerated
2. Parent is institutionalized
3. Child resulted from rape
4. Child resulted from incest
5. Child resulted from sexual exploitation

**Family must prove exception circumstances to receive benefits**

**Impact**:
- Maximum TANF for family of 3 is $303 (unchanged since 1992)
- This amount represents only 17% of federal poverty level
- Combined with SNAP, families still remain below 47% of poverty line

**Policy History**:
- Enacted nearly 30 years ago
- Based on now-debunked stereotypes
- Advocacy efforts ongoing to repeal this provision

### 2. Drug Screening Requirement

**Mandatory Testing** (Florida Statute ยง 414.0652):
- All applicants must undergo drug testing
- Testing occurs before benefits can be issued

**Consequences of Positive Test**:
- Individual is ineligible for 1 year
- Begins from date of positive test result

**Cost Responsibility**:
- Applicant pays for drug test
- Reimbursement may be available if test is negative (check current policy)

**Legal Challenges**:
- Policy has faced constitutional challenges
- Current implementation status should be verified with Florida DCF

### 3. Three-Tier Payment Structure

**Unique Shelter-Based System**:

Florida uses a three-tier payment standard based on shelter obligations, unlike most states that have single payment standard per family size.

**Tier Determination**:
- Based on actual shelter costs (mortgage, rent, room and board)
- Reassessed when housing situation changes
- Homelessness automatically qualifies for Tier 3 (highest benefit)

**Advantage**: Higher payments for families with greater housing costs
**Disadvantage**: More complex eligibility determination
