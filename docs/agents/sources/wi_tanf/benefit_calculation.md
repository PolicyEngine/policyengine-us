## Overview

Wisconsin W-2 benefit calculation is **fundamentally different** from traditional TANF programs:

**Traditional TANF**:
- Benefit varies by family size
- Benefit calculation: Maximum Benefit - (Countable Income × Reduction Rate)
- Income affects both eligibility AND benefit amount

**Wisconsin W-2**:
- Benefit is **fixed amount** based on placement type
- Family size does NOT affect benefit amount
- Income affects eligibility only (pass/fail at 115% FPL)
- No benefit reduction rate or income calculation formula

**Key Principle**: If a family is eligible for W-2 (income ≤ 115% FPL), they receive the full fixed payment for their placement type, regardless of actual income level or family size.

---

## Placement Types and Monthly Payments

Wisconsin W-2 operates through five placement types, each with a fixed monthly payment amount. Placement assignment is determined by W-2 agency assessment of participant's employment readiness and barriers - NOT by family size or income level.

## Benefit Calculation Formula

### For Most Placements (CSJ, W-2 T, CMC, ARP)

```
IF household is eligible for W-2 (income ≤ 115% FPL, assets ≤ $2,500, etc.):
    Monthly Benefit = Fixed Amount for Placement Type
    (CSJ: $653, W-2 T: $608, CMC: $673, ARP: $673)
ELSE:
    Monthly Benefit = $0
```

**No calculations based on**:
- Family size
- Number of children
- Income level (within eligible range)
- Actual expenses
- Other household circumstances

### Reductions for Non-Participation

**CSJ and W-2 T Only**:
```
Monthly Benefit = Base Amount - (Unexcused Absence Hours × $5.00)
```

**Maximum Reduction**: Could reduce benefit to $0 if all hours are unexcused absences

**CMC and ARP**: No reductions - these placements have no participation requirements

### TEMP Subsidy Calculation

```
Participant Receives: Hours Worked × Hourly Wage (≥ minimum wage)
Employer Receives from W-2: Hours Worked × Negotiated Subsidy Rate
```

Example:
- Participant works 30 hours/week at $15/hour
- Subsidy negotiated at $4.50/hour
- Participant receives: 30 × $15 = $450/week from employer
- Employer receives: 30 × $4.50 = $135/week subsidy from W-2

## Payment Issuance

### Payment Cycles

Wisconsin uses two CARES payment cycles:

1. **W-2 Pulldown Payment Cycle (W2P)**:
   - Occurs about 5 days prior to end of month
   - Participants receive checks by last day of month

2. **W-2 Delayed Payment Cycle (W2L)**:
   - Occurs around 7th of month
   - Participants receive checks by 10th of month

### Participation Period

**W-2 participation period**: From the **16th of a month to the 15th of the next month**

This affects when new participants receive initial payments.

### Payment Content

W-2 payments include all reductions for:
- Missed hours of assigned activities
- Other penalties imposed during participation period

## Placement Assignment (NON-SIMULATABLE)

**Critical Limitation**: In actual W-2 program, placement type is determined by Financial and Employment Planner assessment based on:
- Employment readiness
- Work history
- Barriers to employment
- Medical conditions
- Caregiving responsibilities
- Good cause determinations

**For PolicyEngine Implementation**: Cannot model placement assignment. Recommend:
- Use **CSJ ($653/month)** as default/standard benefit for simplified implementation
- OR create separate variables for each placement type eligibility
- Document assumption clearly in variable metadata

---

## Additional Benefits and Services

Beyond cash assistance, W-2 participants may be eligible for:

**Child Care**: Wisconsin Shares child care subsidy

**Transportation**: Transportation assistance for work-related travel

**Job Access Loans**: Loans for work-related expenses (tools, uniforms, etc.)

**Supportive Services**: Various support services to remove employment barriers

**Tax Credits**: Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Child Tax Credit (CTC)

**Other Programs**: FoodShare (SNAP), Medicaid, housing assistance

**Note**: These are separate programs with own eligibility rules - NOT part of W-2 cash benefit calculation

## Historical Context

### Prior to W-2 (Before September 1997)

Wisconsin operated Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), which:
- Varied benefits by family size
- Used benefit reduction rates
- Had different eligibility rules

### W-2 Implementation (September 1997)

Wisconsin was the **first state** to submit TANF state plan (August 22, 1996) and implemented W-2 in September 1997.

**Major Changes**:
- Fixed payments instead of family-size-based benefits
- Employment placements instead of traditional cash assistance
- Work-first philosophy
- Extensive income disregards (especially child support)

### Recent Updates

**2024-2025**: Current payment amounts
- Payment standards have remained relatively stable
- Income limits updated annually with FPL
- Policy updates through regular manual releases

## Comparison to Other States

### Unique Features of Wisconsin W-2

1. **Fixed Payments**: One of only two states with same benefit regardless of family size

2. **Employment Placements**: Structured around work capacity, not family composition

3. **Extensive Disregards**: All child support disregarded (most states count some child support)

4. **No Benefit Formula**: Income used only for eligibility, not benefit calculation

### States with Similar Approaches

Very few states use fixed-payment approach. Most TANF programs:
- Vary benefits by family size
- Calculate benefits as: Max Benefit - (Income × Reduction Rate)
- Count child support as income (with passthrough/disregard)

## Implementation Guidance for PolicyEngine

### Recommended Approach

**Step 1: Eligibility Determination**
```python
wi_tanf_eligible = (
    wi_tanf_income_eligible &  # Income ≤ 115% FPL
    wi_tanf_asset_eligible &   # Assets ≤ $2,500
    wi_tanf_demographic_eligible &  # Age, custodial parent, etc.
    wi_tanf_categorical_eligible  # Not receiving SSI/SSDI
)
```

**Step 2: Benefit Amount**
```python
# Simplified approach: Use CSJ as standard benefit
wi_tanf = where(wi_tanf_eligible, 653, 0)

# OR: Implement multiple placement types
wi_tanf_csj = where(wi_tanf_csj_eligible, 653, 0)
wi_tanf_w2t = where(wi_tanf_w2t_eligible, 608, 0)
wi_tanf_cmc = where(wi_tanf_cmc_eligible, 673, 0)
wi_tanf_arp = where(wi_tanf_arp_eligible, 673, 0)

wi_tanf = wi_tanf_csj + wi_tanf_w2t + wi_tanf_cmc + wi_tanf_arp
```

**Step 3: Documentation**
Clearly document in variable metadata:
- Wisconsin uses fixed payments, not family-size-based benefits
- Actual benefit depends on placement assignment by W-2 agency
- Implementation assumes [CSJ/multiple placement types]
- Cannot model participation requirements or sanctions

### Metadata Example

```python
class wi_tanf(Variable):
    value_type = float
    entity = SPMUnit
    label = "Wisconsin TANF (W-2) benefit"
    unit = USD
    definition_period = MONTH
    reference = "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/49/iii/148"
    documentation = """
    Wisconsin Works (W-2) provides fixed monthly payments based on
    placement type, not family size. This implementation assumes
    Community Service Job (CSJ) placement at $653/month for eligible
    families. Actual benefits depend on W-2 agency placement assignment.
    """

    def formula(spm_unit, period, parameters):
        p = parameters(period).gov.states.wi.tanf

        # Determine eligibility
        eligible = spm_unit("wi_tanf_eligible", period)

        # Return fixed payment amount (CSJ)
        return where(eligible, p.payment_standards.csj, 0)
```
