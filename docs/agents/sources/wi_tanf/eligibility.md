## Overview

Wisconsin Works (W-2) eligibility is determined by both **financial** and **nonfinancial** criteria. Unlike traditional TANF programs, Wisconsin uses income only for eligibility determination - not for benefit calculation. Eligible families receive fixed monthly payments based on placement type, regardless of income level (as long as income is below 115% FPL).
