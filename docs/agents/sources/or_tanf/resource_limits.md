# Oregon TANF Resource Limits

## Legal Authority
- **Primary Rule**: OAR 461-160-0015 - Resource Limits
- **Effective Date**: October 1, 2024 (most recent amendment)

## Resource Limit Structure

Oregon TANF uses a two-tier resource limit system:

### Standard Resource Limit: $10,000

This limit applies to:
- New TANF applicants
- Need groups with at least one caretaker relative or parent currently receiving TANF
- Need groups without a JOBS disqualification

### Lower Resource Limit: $2,500

This limit applies to:
- Need groups where **every** caretaker relative is serving an intentional program violation
- Need groups where **every** caretaker relative has a current JOBS disqualification

## Key Points

1. **Most families face the $10,000 limit** - The lower $2,500 limit only applies in specific disqualification scenarios

2. **New applicants**: Subject to $10,000 limit (the lower limit does not apply to new applicants)

3. **Ongoing cases**: Subject to $10,000 limit unless all caretaker relatives have disqualifications

## Resource Definition

Resources include:
- Cash and bank accounts
- Vehicles (above certain exclusions)
- Property (non-homestead)
- Other countable assets

Note: Specific resource exclusions and counting rules are found in OAR 461-140 and 461-145 series.

## Historical Context

Oregon has increased its resource limit to $10,000, which is higher than many other states. This allows families to retain more savings while maintaining TANF eligibility.
