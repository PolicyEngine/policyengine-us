## Child-Only Cases (Need Groups Without Adult)

For need groups containing no adult, the payment standard is calculated differently:
- Use the standard for need groups with adults
- Use the standard for the number of individuals in the household group
- Divide by the number of individuals in the household group
- Round down to the next lower whole number

## Non-Needy Caretaker Relative Standard

A caretaker relative (other than a parent) who chooses not to be included in the need group is subject to a countable income limit of **185% of the Federal Poverty Level**.

## Application of Standards (OAR 461-160-0100)

### For Non-ELI Eligible Individuals

**Step 1**: Compare countable income to Countable Income Limit Standard
- If countable income >= standard: NOT ELIGIBLE

**Step 2**: Compare adjusted income to Adjusted Income Limit Standard
- If adjusted income >= standard: NOT ELIGIBLE

**Step 3**: Calculate benefit
- Benefit = Payment Standard - Adjusted Income

### For ELI-Eligible Individuals

Families are eligible for ELI standards when:
- The benefit group has earned income
- The earned income was earned by an individual in the benefit group
- They are within a certification period OR
- They filed within 30 days of closure due to earned income

**Step 1**: Compare countable income to ELI Standard
- If countable income >= ELI standard: NOT ELIGIBLE

**Step 2**: Calculate benefit
- Benefit = Payment Standard - Adjusted Income

## Minimum Benefit (OAR 461-165-0060)

- Benefits are **not issued** if monthly benefit is less than **$10**
- Individuals may still qualify for medical benefits even if cash benefit is below $10

## Historical Context

- The $506 payment for a family of 3 represents approximately 24% of the 2024 Federal Poverty Level
- Payment standards have remained unchanged since July 1, 2011
