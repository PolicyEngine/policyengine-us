# Iowa FIP (Family Investment Program) Benefit Calculation

## Legal Authority

- **Iowa Administrative Code 441-41.27(239B)**: Income
- **Iowa Administrative Code 441-41.28(239B)**: Need Standards

## Income Eligibility Tests

Iowa FIP uses a three-test system for initial eligibility and a two-test system for continuing eligibility.

### Initial Eligibility (Three-Step Process)

1. **Test 1: 185% Gross Income Test**
   - Countable gross nonexempt unearned and earned income must be at or below 185% of the Standard of Need for the eligible group size

2. **Test 2: Standard of Need Test (Net Income)**
   - Applied only to applicant families and reapplicants
   - Calculation: Gross nonexempt income minus 20% earned income deduction and diversions
   - If income >= Standard of Need: application denied
   - If income < Standard of Need: eligible for 50% work incentive deduction (58% per current rules)
   - Standards found in Schedule of Living Costs (Desk Aid RC-0033)

3. **Test 3: Payment Standard Test**
   - Applied if Tests 1 and 2 are passed
   - Calculation: Net income from Test 2 plus work incentive deduction
   - If income >= Payment Standard: no eligibility
   - If income < Payment Standard: FIP grant = Payment Standard - countable net income

Reference: Iowa Administrative Code 441-41.27(239B)

### Continuing Eligibility (Two-Step Process)

1. Gross nonexempt income cannot exceed 185% of Standard of Need
2. Countable net income must be below Payment Standard

## Income Deductions and Disregards

### 20% Earned Income Deduction

Each person in the assistance unit whose gross nonexempt earned income is considered is entitled to a **20% earned income deduction** of nonexempt monthly gross earnings.

This deduction covers work-related expenses including:
- Taxes
- Transportation
- Meals
- Uniforms
- Other work-related expenses

Reference: Iowa Administrative Code 441-41.27(239B)

### Work Incentive Disregard (58%)

After deducting the 20% earned income deduction and income diversions, the department disregards **58%** of the total remaining monthly nonexempt earned income.

This applies to:
- Earnings as an employee
- Net profit from self-employment

**Note:** The work incentive disregard is NOT time-limited, but does not apply during initial eligibility determination (Test 2).

## Benefit Calculation Formula

### For Eligible Families

```
FIP Benefit = Payment Standard - Countable Net Income
```

Where Countable Net Income is calculated as:

**For Initial Applicants (Test 3):**
```
Countable Net Income = Gross Income - 20% Earned Income Deduction - Diversions - 58% Work Incentive
```

**For Recipients:**
```
Countable Net Income = Gross Income - 20% Earned Income Deduction - Diversions - 58% Work Incentive
```

## Special Needs Allowances

- **Guardian/conservator fee**: An amount not to exceed $10 per case per month may be allowed

## Income Attribution and Budgeting

### Prospective Budgeting
Iowa FIP uses prospective budgeting - "a projection of income based on the best estimate of future income."

### Variable Income
For variable income: "all income received in the period being used and dividing the result by the number of instances" establishes the monthly projection.

### Income Conversion Rules
- **Weekly Income**: Multiply by 4 regardless of actual payment frequency
- **Biweekly Income**: Multiply by 2 regardless of actual payment frequency

### Self-Employment Income
Self-employment income not received regularly is "averaged over a 12-month period of time."

Reference: Iowa Administrative Code 441-41.27(239B)

## Example Calculation

**Family of 3 with one employed parent earning $800/month gross:**

1. **Test 1 (185% Gross Income Test):**
   - Gross Income: $800
   - 185% Standard of Need for 3: $1,570.65
   - $800 < $1,570.65 - PASS

2. **Test 2 (Standard of Need Test - Applicant Only):**
   - Gross Income: $800
   - 20% Earned Income Deduction: $800 x 0.20 = $160
   - Net Income: $800 - $160 = $640
   - Standard of Need for 3: $849
   - $640 < $849 - PASS (eligible for work incentive)

3. **Test 3 (Payment Standard Test):**
   - Net Income from Test 2: $640
   - 58% Work Incentive: $640 x 0.58 = $371.20
   - Countable Net Income: $640 - $371.20 = $268.80
   - Payment Standard for 3: $426
   - $268.80 < $426 - PASS

4. **Benefit Calculation:**
   - FIP Benefit = $426 - $268.80 = $157.20/month
