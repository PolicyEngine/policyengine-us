|----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|

### For Larger Households (9+ members)
- Use **150% of Federal Poverty Guidelines**
- Add approximately $745 per month for each additional person above 8

## Income Calculation Methodology

### Federal Formula (45 CFR 96.85)
The 60% SMI limits are calculated using adjustment factors:

```
Income Limit = (60% of 4-person State Median Income) × Adjustment Factor

Adjustment Factors:
- 1 person:  52% = 0.52
- 2 persons: 68% = 0.68
- 3 persons: 84% = 0.84
- 4 persons: 100% = 1.00
- 5 persons: 116% = 1.16
- 6 persons: 132% = 1.32
- 7+ persons: Add 3% for each additional member
```

### Arizona's 4-Person Base (FY 2025)
- **4-Person State Median Income**: $113,300 (estimated)
- **60% of SMI for 4-person household**: $67,980 annually ($5,665 monthly)

## Income Counting Rules

### What Counts as Income

#### Earned Income

#### Special Situations
- **All household members 18+**: Income counts regardless of citizenship

- **In-kind income**: Not counted unless converted to cash

### What Does NOT Count as Income

#### Categorical Program Benefits

## Income Determination Period

### Standard Period
- **Most recent 30 calendar days** before application
- Must be consecutive days
- Use actual income received (not earned) in period

### Annualization
For variable income:
1. Take 30-day total
2. Multiply by 12 to annualize
3. Compare to annual limits

### Example Calculation
```
30-day income: $2,000
Annualized: $2,000 × 12 = $24,000
Household size: 3
Annual limit: $57,096
Eligible? Yes ($24,000 < $57,096)
Percentage: $24,000 ÷ $57,096 = 42%
```

## Categorical Eligibility

### Automatic Income Qualification
Households receiving these benefits are deemed income-eligible:
- **TANF** (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families)
- **SNAP** (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program)

### Documentation
- No income verification required
- Must provide proof of current benefit receipt
- Income verified through DES database

## Special Income Situations

- Requires profit/loss statement or tax records
- 30-day average if variable

### Seasonal Workers

- Consider periods of unemployment
- Document seasonal nature

### Irregular Income

- May require additional documentation

## Income and Benefit Relationship

### Points Assignment by Income Level

| Income as % of Limit | Points | Typical Benefit Range |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------|

| 31-50%              | 4      | $360-$480          |
| 51-70%              | 3      | $240-$360          |
| 71-85%              | 2      | $180-$240          |
| 86-100%             | 1      | $160-$180          |
