## Benefit Amounts (FY 2025)

  - Minimum: $160
  - Maximum: $640

## Points-Based Benefit Calculation System

Arizona uses a points system that considers three factors:
1. Household income level
2. Energy burden
3. Household demographics (vulnerability)

**Key Principle**: More points = Higher benefit amount within the $160-$640 range

## Points Allocation Tables

### 1. Income Level Points

| Income as % of Poverty Level | Points Assigned |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| 0-74%                        | 5               |
| 75-100%                      | 4               |
| 101-125%                     | 3               |
| 126-150%                     | 2               |
| 151-200%                     | 1               |

**Calculation Formula**:
```
% Income = (Total Monthly Gross Income) / (Monthly Gross Income Limit for Household Size)
```

**Example**:
- Household of 3 with $2,000 monthly income
- Income limit for size 3: $4,535
- Calculation: $2,000 / $4,535 = 44%
- Points awarded: 5 (falls in 0-74% range)

### 2. Energy Burden Points

| Energy Burden (% of Income) | Points Assigned |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| 21% or more                 | 6               |
| 16-20%                      | 5               |
| 11-15%                      | 4               |
| 6-10%                       | 3               |
| 1-5%                        | 1               |
| Less than 1%                | 0               |

**Calculation Formula**:
```
Energy Burden % = (Total Monthly Energy Costs) / (Total Monthly Gross Income) × 100
```

**Example**:
- Monthly income: $2,000
- Monthly electric bill: $350
- Calculation: $350 / $2,000 = 17.5%
- Points awarded: 5 (falls in 16-20% range)

### 3. Demographic/Vulnerability Points

| Household Characteristic | Points Assigned |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Member age 60+          | 1               |
| Disabled member         | 1               |
| Child under age 6       | 1               |
| Life-sustaining medical equipment | Additional consideration |

**Notes**:
- Points are cumulative (can receive points for multiple characteristics)
- Disability verified through benefits receipt or medical documentation

## Total Points to Benefit Amount Conversion

### Benefit Matrix (Approximate ranges based on total points)

| Total Points | Benefit Range |
|--------------|---------------|
| 0-3          | $160-$200     |
| 4-6          | $200-$300     |
| 7-9          | $300-$480     |
| 10-12        | $480-$640     |
| 13+          | $640          |

**Note**: Exact benefit amounts within ranges determined by available funding and applicant pool

## Detailed Calculation Example

### Case Study: Elderly Disabled Household

**Household Profile**:
- 84-year-old disabled woman living alone
- Monthly income: $758.10 (Social Security)
- Monthly electric bill: $40
- Monthly gas bill: $34
- Total energy costs: $74

**Step 1: Calculate Income Points**
- Federal Poverty Level for 1 person (2025): ~$1,215/month
- Income percentage: $758.10 / $1,215 = 62%
- Income range: 0-74% of poverty
- **Income Points: 5**

**Step 2: Calculate Energy Burden Points**
- Energy burden: $74 / $758.10 = 9.8%
- Burden range: 6-10%
- **Energy Burden Points: 3**

**Step 3: Calculate Demographic Points**
- Elderly (60+): 1 point
- Disabled: 1 point
- **Demographic Points: 2**

**Step 4: Calculate Total Points and Benefit**
- Total Points: 5 + 3 + 2 = 10
- Benefit Range: $480-$640
- **Estimated Benefit: $480**

## Crisis Assistance Calculation

### Eligibility Criteria
1. **Regular Crisis** (any of the following):
   - Utility shut-off notice received
   - Delinquency notice received
   - Regular LIHEAP benefit insufficient to cover bill
   - Eviction notice (if utilities included in rent)
   - Portable fuel/prepay with ≤7 days supply

2. **Life-Threatening Crisis**:
   - Medical documentation required
   - Termination would endanger health
   - Physician statement needed

### Crisis Benefit Amount Determination
- Based on actual amount needed to prevent disconnection
- Maximum of $500
- Cannot exceed actual past-due amount
- Must be used for energy costs only

## Special Calculation Considerations

### Categorical Eligibility
- SNAP/TANF recipients automatically income-eligible
- Still subject to points calculation for benefit amount
- May receive maximum points for income category

### Shared Households
- Total household income divided by household size
- Energy costs may be prorated if shared
- Individual circumstances considered

### Seasonal Adjustments
- No difference in benefit amounts between heating and cooling
- Same points system applies year-round
- Availability depends on regional program dates

## Payment Process

### Direct Vendor Payment
- Benefits paid directly to utility company
- Applied to customer account
- Excess credit may carry forward

### Payment Priority
1. Past due amounts
2. Current charges
3. Future charges (if credit remains)

## Annual Adjustments

**Factors Affecting Benefits**:
- Federal funding allocation to Arizona
- Number of eligible applicants
- Energy cost trends
- State supplemental funding (if any)

**Note**: Benefit amounts and points system subject to annual review and adjustment based on federal funding levels
