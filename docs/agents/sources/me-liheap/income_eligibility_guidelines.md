# Maine LIHEAP Income Eligibility Guidelines

## Federal Income Eligibility Framework

### Primary Rule
Maine LIHEAP eligibility is based on the **greater of**:
- 150% of Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), OR
- 60% of State Median Income (SMI)

### Secondary Rules
- **Minimum threshold**: Cannot exclude households below 110% of FPG
- **Household size >9**: Uses 150% FPG when 60% SMI would be lower
- **Maximum allowable**: Cannot exceed the greater of 150% FPG or 60% SMI

## Maine-Specific Implementation

### Primary Threshold: 60% State Median Income
Maine uses **60% State Median Income** as its primary eligibility threshold because it results in higher income limits than 150% FPG for most household sizes.

## Federal SMI Calculation Method

### Household Size Multipliers for 60% SMI
The 4-person household SMI is multiplied by these percentages:
- 1 person: 52% (0.52)
- 2 persons: 68% (0.68)
- 3 persons: 84% (0.84)
- 4 persons: 100% (1.00)
- 5 persons: 116% (1.16)
- 6 persons: 132% (1.32)

### For Households > 6 Persons
- Add 3% (0.03) for each additional household member above 6
- Formula: (132% + (household_size - 6) × 3%) × 4-person SMI × 0.60

### For Households > 12 Persons
- Base: 4-person family × 150% + 3% for each member above 12
- Formula: (150% + (household_size - 12) × 3%) × 4-person SMI × 0.60

## Income Deductions and Adjustments

### Allowable Deductions
1. **Court-ordered child support payments**: May be deducted from household income
2. **Medical expenses**: Portion may be deducted if household income exceeds HEAP guidelines

### Income Definition
- **Gross household income** based on household size
- Income from all household members counted
- Standard LIHEAP income counting rules apply

## Implementation Timeline
- States may adopt new federal income guidelines anytime between publication and October 1
- Must adjust income eligibility criteria by October 1 or beginning of state fiscal year, whichever is later
- Most grantees use prior year guidelines until October 1 to avoid mid-year changes
