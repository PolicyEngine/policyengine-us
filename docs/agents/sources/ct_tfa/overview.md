## Benefit Payment Standards

### Historical Context

**Prior to July 1, 2022**:
- Connecticut had three payment regions (A, B, C) based on local housing costs
- Region A: Highest benefit amounts (highest housing cost areas)
- Region B: Middle benefit amounts
- Region C: Lower benefit amounts (similar to B for smaller families)

**Public Act 22-118 Change (Effective July 1, 2022)**:
- Made TFA benefit levels **uniform statewide**
- Eliminated regional variations
- Indexed benefits to Federal Poverty Level
- Provides automatic annual adjustments

**Source**: Connecticut TANF State Plan 2024-2026, multiple search results confirming PA 22-118 implementation

### Current Benefit Amounts (Post-2022)

**Important Note**: Public Act 22-118 made benefits uniform across Connecticut starting July 1, 2022. Benefits are now calculated as a percentage of the Federal Poverty Level rather than fixed regional amounts.

**Reported 2024 Benefit Amount**:
- Family of 3 with no income: **$833/month** (statewide)

**Source**: Multiple Connecticut DSS sources citing 2024 rates

| 6           | $1,028   | $908     | $885     |
| 7           | $1,143   | $1,026   | $994     |
| 8           | $1,257   | $1,134   | $1,100   |
