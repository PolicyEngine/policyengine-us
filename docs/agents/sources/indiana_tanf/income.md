## Earned Income Disregards

### Two Disregard Systems

Indiana appears to use **two different disregard systems** for different purposes:

#### System 1: For Benefit Calculation (Confirmed)

**75% Disregard**:
- 75% of gross earned income is disregarded
- Only 25% of earnings counted in benefit calculation
- Applies throughout TANF receipt
- Most generous to recipients

**Formula**:
```
Countable Earned Income = Gross Earned Income × 0.25
```

**Source**:
- WIOA State Plan: https://wioaplans.ed.gov/node/67731
- Confirmed in multiple sources

#### System 2: For Eligibility Determination (Needs Clarification)

**Two Versions Found:**

**Version A: "$30 and 1/3" Method**
- $30 disregard PLUS 1/3 of remaining earned income
- Applied after work expense disregard
- Duration: First 4 consecutive months of employment
- Used to determine if household meets income eligibility threshold

**Version B: "$120/$90" Method** (from NCCP)
- **Months 1-4**: Disregard $120 + 1/3 of remaining earnings
- **Months 5-12**: Disregard $120 of earnings
- **Months 13+**: Disregard $90 of earnings

**Discrepancy**: These two versions cannot both be correct. Policy Manual Chapter 2800 PDF extraction needed to resolve.

**Sources**:
- Version A: WIOA State Plan, NCCP profile
- Version B: NCCP TANF profile (https://www.nccp.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/TANF-profile-Indiana.pdf)

### Work Expense Deduction

**Application**:
- Applied to gross earned income before other disregards
- Specific amounts and methodology not detailed in HTML sources

**Source**: Policy Manual Chapter 2800 (PDF extraction needed)

### Example Calculations

**Example 1: Using 75% Disregard (Benefit Calculation)**

Family earns $400/month:
```
Gross Earned Income: $400
Apply 75% Disregard: $400 × 0.75 = $300 disregarded
Countable Earned Income: $400 × 0.25 = $100
```

**Example 2: Using $30 and 1/3 Method (Eligibility - Version A)**

Family earns $600/month (first 4 months):
```
Gross Earned Income: $600
Work Expense Deduction: $0 (unknown amount)
After Work Expenses: $600
Disregard $30: $600 - $30 = $570 remaining
Disregard 1/3 of remaining: $570 × 0.333 = $190 disregarded
Countable: $30 + ($570 - $190) = $30 + $380 = $410
```

**Example 3: Using $120 Method (Eligibility - Version B)**

Family earns $600/month (months 1-4):
```
Gross Earned Income: $600
Disregard $120: $600 - $120 = $480 remaining
Disregard 1/3 of remaining: $480 × 0.333 = $160 disregarded
Countable: $120 + ($480 - $160) = $120 + $320 = $440
```

**Note**: These different methods produce different countable income amounts. Resolution needed.

## Unearned Income Disregards

### General Rule

**No Disregard for Benefit Calculation**:
- Unearned income counted 100% in benefit calculation
- No general disregard like earned income's 75%

**Exception**: Child support (see below)

### Child Support Treatment

**Counted as Income**:
- Child support is unearned income
- Attributed to child, not parent
- Counted 100% in benefit calculation (no disregard)

**No Passthrough Identified**:
- Child support collected while receiving TANF retained by state
- Used for TANF cost recovery
- No explicit passthrough or disregard found in accessible sources

**Child Support Assignment**:
- Recipients must assign child support rights to state
- Assignment amount = lesser of:
  - TANF benefits received that month, OR
  - Child support due that month

**Note**: State Plan PDF (page 10) may contain child support passthrough details if any exists.

### Federal Income Exclusions

While specific exclusions not detailed in HTML sources, federal TANF law typically excludes:

- EITC payments
- Child tax credit payments
- Certain educational grants and scholarships
- Certain in-kind assistance
- Tax refunds

## Income Attribution Rules

### Child Support

**Attribution to Child**:
> "Child support is considered unearned income and is the child's income for TANF purposes."

This means:
- Child support counted in household income
- But attributed to child, not parent
- Relevant for household composition rules

**Source**: Policy Manual Chapter 2800

### Household Income Aggregation

**TANF Assistance Group**:
- Income of all members in TANF assistance group considered
- Assistance group defined per IC 12-14-1-0.5

## Comparison to Federal TANF Baseline

### Federal Income Disregards

**Federal TANF Baseline** (from regulations):
- First $90 of monthly earned income disregarded
- Additional amounts may be disregarded for work expenses
- States have flexibility to set their own disregards

**Indiana's Approach**:
- More generous: 75% earned income disregard vs. $90 flat
- Encourages work by allowing recipients to keep more earnings
- Progressive policy compared to minimal federal requirement

## Implementation in PolicyEngine

### Income Source Variables Needed

**State-Specific or Federal Baseline?**

**Recommendation**: Use federal baseline with Indiana-specific disregards
- Income source definitions likely match federal TANF baseline
- Disregard amounts are Indiana-specific

**Variables**:
```python
# Can likely use federal baseline:
- tanf_gross_earned_income
- tanf_gross_unearned_income

# Indiana-specific disregard calculation:
- in_tanf_earned_income_disregard
- in_tanf_countable_earned_income
- in_tanf_countable_unearned_income
- in_tanf_countable_income
```

### Parameter Structure

```yaml
# in_tanf_income_disregards.yaml
in_tanf:
  earned_income_disregard:
    # For benefit calculation
    benefit_calculation:
      rate: 0.75  # 75% disregarded
      description: "Percentage of earned income disregarded in benefit calculation"

## Outstanding Questions

### Critical Questions Requiring PDF Extraction

1. **Earned Income Disregard Methodology**:
   - Is $30+1/3 method used for eligibility?
   - Is $120/$90 method used instead?
   - Do both apply (one for eligibility, one for benefit)?
   - Has one method been superseded by SEA 265?

2. **Work Expense Deduction**:
   - What are allowable work expenses?
   - Are there flat amounts or actual costs?
   - Applied before or after other disregards?

3. **Income Exclusions**:
   - Complete list of excluded income sources
   - Treatment of EITC, CTC, tax refunds
   - Treatment of educational assistance
   - Treatment of in-kind assistance

4. **Child Support Details**:
   - Is there any passthrough amount?
   - Is there any disregard?
   - State Plan page 10 may clarify

5. **Self-Employment**:
   - Allowable business expense deductions
   - Net profit calculation methodology
   - Depreciation treatment

6. **Income Budgeting**:
   - Prospective vs. retrospective
   - Averaging methodology for irregular income
   - Treatment of one-time lump sums
