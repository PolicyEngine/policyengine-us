### Budget Impact

**Fiscal Note**:
- Specific cost estimates not accessible in HTML sources
- Likely included state General Fund appropriations
- May include federal TANF fund implications

**Federal Implications**:
- Federal debt deal in 2023 included TANF work requirements
- May have affected Indiana's implementation timeline
- SEA 265 proceeded despite federal concerns

**Source**:
- News: https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/congress-debt-deal-may-hinder-a-new-indiana-law-to-extend-tanf-benefits-to-thousands-of-families

### Projected Impact

**Families Affected**:
- Thousands of additional families will qualify
- Existing recipients receive higher benefits
- Pregnant women newly eligible

**Economic Impact**:
- Increased purchasing power for low-income families
- Potential economic stimulus effect
- Reduced deep poverty

**Quote from Analysis**:
> "Indiana is among states that impose waiting periods or benefit limits beyond basic federal requirements."

SEA 265 addresses some of these restrictions while maintaining others (like 24-month adult time limit).

### Provisions NOT Changed by SEA 265

**Remained Unchanged**:
- Resource limits ($1,000/$10,000)
- Vehicle equity exclusion ($20,000)
- Time limits (24 months for adults, 60 months for children)
- Work requirements (IMPACT program)
- Child support assignment requirements
- Residency requirements
- Citizenship requirements

**Implication**: While SEA 265 is significant, it addresses only income eligibility and benefit amounts, not other program restrictions.

## Implementation in PolicyEngine

### Time-Based Parameter Changes

```yaml
# in_tanf_income_limits.yaml
in_tanf:
  net_income_limit:
    # Current limits (pre-SEA 265 expansion)
    2024-01-01:
      3: 513
      # ... other family sizes

    # July 2025: First expansion (percentage TBD)
    2025-07-01:
      3: TBD  # Needs implementing regulation details
      # ... other family sizes

    # December 2027: Full 50% FPL
    2027-12-31:
      3: TBD  # Calculate as 50% of FPL for family of 3
      # ... other family sizes

  payment_standard:
    # Historical frozen amount
    1996-01-01:
      3: 288

    # First increase
    2022-07-01:
      3: 320

    # SEA 265 increase
    2024-01-01:
      3: 513

    # Future COLA (methodology TBD)
    # 2025-07-01: TBD
    # 2026-01-01: TBD
```

### Variable Considerations

**Pregnant Women Eligibility**:
```python
def formula_in_tanf_demographic_eligible(person, period, parameters):
    """Indiana TANF demographic eligibility including pregnant women."""
    # Standard demographic eligibility
    standard = person("is_demographic_tanf_eligible", period)

    # Pregnant woman provision (SEA 265)
    is_pregnant = person("is_pregnant", period)
    pregnancy_months = person("pregnancy_months", period)
    pregnant_eligible = is_pregnant & (pregnancy_months >= 6)

    return standard | pregnant_eligible
```

### Testing Strategy

**Need Tests For**:
1. Pre-2025 rules (historical accuracy)
2. July 2025 expansion (once percentages known)
3. 2027 full expansion (50% FPL)
4. COLA adjustments (once methodology known)
5. Pregnant women eligibility (6+ months)

## Outstanding Questions

### Critical Information Gaps

1. **Year-by-Year Expansion Schedule**:
   - What are the exact FPL percentages for 2025, 2026, early 2027?
   - Monthly or annual implementation dates?
   - How are family size-based limits calculated at each step?

2. **COLA Methodology**:
   - What inflation index is used?
   - What is the adjustment timing (monthly, quarterly, annual)?
   - Are there rounding rules?
   - Is there a cap on annual adjustments?

3. **Implementing Regulations**:
   - Have final rules been promulgated?
   - Are there effective dates different from statutory dates?
   - Are there transitional provisions?

4. **Benefit Amount Formula**:
   - Did SEA 265 change the benefit calculation formula?
   - Or just increase the payment standard amounts?
   - Was earned income disregard affected?

5. **Pregnant Women Details**:
   - Exactly 6 months or "at least" 6 months?
   - How is pregnancy verification handled?
   - Can pregnant woman without other children qualify alone?
   - What family size is pregnant woman counted as?

### Resolution Sources

**Primary**:
- Bill text of SEA 265 (requires JavaScript extraction)
- Implementing regulations (470 IAC 10.3 updates)
- Updated State Plan (2026 draft when finalized)

**Secondary**:
- FSSA program guidance documents
- Policy manual updates
- Official benefit calculators

**Tertiary**:
- Legislative fiscal notes
- FSSA budget documents
- Federal ACF correspondence

2. **Obtain implementing regulations** (470 IAC updates)
3. **Review 2026 State Plan** when finalized
4. **Identify exact expansion percentages** for 2025-2027
5. **Determine COLA methodology** from regulations
6. **Create comprehensive timeline** for parameter values
7. **Build YAML tests** for each implementation phase
