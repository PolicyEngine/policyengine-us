# Indiana TANF - Resource Limits

## Legal Authority

- **Indiana Code**: IC 12-14-1-1 (Eligibility - Resource Provisions)
- **Administrative Code**: 470 IAC 10.3-4-2 (Real and Personal Property Ownership)
- **Policy Manual**: Chapter 2400 (Nonfinancial Eligibility)

## Resource Limit Structure

### Two-Tier System

Indiana uses a unique **two-tier resource limit system** that varies based on applicant vs. recipient status.

#### Application Phase

**Maximum Countable Resources**: $1,000

Applies when:
- Initially applying for TANF
- Determining initial eligibility
- Family has never received TANF or is reapplying

**Purpose**: More restrictive entry requirement

#### Receipt Phase

**Maximum Countable Resources**: $10,000

Applies when:
- Family is currently receiving TANF benefits
- Continuing eligibility determination
- Family already qualified and on program

**Statutory Provision** (IC 12-14-1-1):
> "A TANF assistance group that has qualified for and is receiving assistance under TANF does not cease to qualify due solely to an increase in resources so long as the resources are valued at not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000)."

### Comparison to Other States

| State | Application Limit | Receipt Limit | Notes |
|-------|------------------|---------------|-------|
| Indiana | $1,000 | $10,000 | Two-tier system |
| Montana | $3,000 | $3,000 | Single limit |
| Federal Baseline | Varies by state | Varies by state | No federal requirement |

Indiana's two-tier system is more restrictive for applicants but more generous for recipients than many states.

## Excluded Resources

### Primary Residence

**Exclusion**:
> "The house, which is the usual residence, is exempt."

**Details**:
- Home where family lives is fully excluded
- No equity limit specified
- Must be "usual residence" (primary home)

**Questions**:
- What about vacation homes or second properties?
- What if family temporarily displaced?

**Source**: FSSA website

### Motor Vehicles

**Vehicle Equity Exclusion**: $20,000 total

**Calculation**:
```
Equity Value = Fair Market Value - Amount Owed
```

**Application**:
- Applies to **total equity** in all vehicles
- Owned by any family member
- Not per-vehicle, but total household vehicle equity

**Example**:
```
Vehicle 1: FMV $15,000, Owed $5,000 → Equity $10,000
Vehicle 2: FMV $8,000, Owed $0 → Equity $8,000
Total Equity: $18,000
Excluded: $18,000 (under $20,000 limit)
Countable: $0
```

**Example with Excess**:
```
Vehicle 1: FMV $25,000, Owed $0 → Equity $25,000
Total Equity: $25,000
Excluded: $20,000
Countable: $5,000
```

## Temporary Increases in Resources

### Within Receipt Phase

**IC 12-14-1-1 Protection**:
> "Does not cease to qualify due solely to an increase in resources so long as the resources are valued at not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000)."

**Examples of Protected Increases**:
- Tax refund received while on program
- Inheritance under $10,000
- Savings accumulation from employment
- Asset appreciation (vehicle value increase)

**Limit**: As long as total doesn't exceed $10,000

**Policy Benefit**: Encourages saving and asset building

## Comparison: Application vs. Receipt Phase

| Aspect | Application Phase | Receipt Phase |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Resource Limit** | $1,000 | $10,000 |
| **Purpose** | Initial eligibility screen | Continuing eligibility |
| **Rationale** | Restrictive entry | Promote asset building |
| **Benefit** | Ensures neediest served | Reduces cliff effects |

## Resource Limit Changes Over Time

### Historical Limits

**Timeline**:
- Limits not indexed to inflation
- $1,000/$10,000 limits appear to be longstanding
- No recent increases found

**Context**:
- $1,000 in 1996 (TANF creation) ≈ $1,900 in 2024 dollars
- Real value has eroded significantly
- Two-tier system helps offset this for recipients

### Future Changes

**SEA 265 Impact**:
- No changes to resource limits in SEA 265
- Focused on income eligibility and benefits
- Resource limits remain at $1,000/$10,000

3. **Identify all excluded resource types**
4. **Document transfer of assets rules** (look-back, penalties)
5. **Create YAML tests** for resource test scenarios
