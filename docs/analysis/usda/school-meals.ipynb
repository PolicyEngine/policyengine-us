    "School meal subsidies comprise the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP).\n",
    "Eligibility depends on household size, state, income, and participation in other programs, and assigns children to either a *reduced* or *free* school meal subsidy tier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Eligibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Children whose families have income below 130 percent of the federal poverty line, or who participate in SNAP, TANF, or the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, are eligible for free breakfast and lunch at school.\n",
    "Children who do not meet these criteria and whose families have income below 185 percent of the federal poverty line are eligible for a reduced school meal subsidy.\n",
    "Other children receive a small meal subsidy from the federal government.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefit value\n",
    "\n",
    "We assign the benefit value as the federal reimbursement rates published by USDA.\n",
    "We then multiply this by 180 school days per year.\n",
    "We subtract the subsidy value provided to all children.\n",
